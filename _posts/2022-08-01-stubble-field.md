I have decided that today is **the** day to start this diary, even though technically I am still on summer holiday and my sabbatical does not begin until 1st September. My track record for keeping a written diary is rather poor (on each occassion it lasted for only a few days) but I hope this one will be different!

This photo was taken while I went on a walk. Not far from where I live are some fields. Not long ago, the field was full of wheat. I wonder what I will see on my walk from my flat in Munich in a few weeks' time.

Today's photo is my current set-up in my study. As you can see I am doing a bit of programming, which is one of the aims of my sabbatical: to learn some programming. Currently, my main project requires me using JavaScript to draw graphics. Making the website for this diary is my side project. 

As a complete beginner in computing, the most difficult part is getting the computer set up so I can run the code I have written. It is not hard to write the code to print "hello world", but how do I know what to type in the terminal so I can run the text file containing the code for the first time? I think this is why having someone who knows computing really helps - because once it is set up, then I can read the book and do the exercises.

Harvard's CS50 course is fantastic because it comes with a web-based IDE, which means I don't need to set up anything on my computer. I am glad someone has thought about the hurdles that a complete beginner with no experencing of programming needs to face before one can actually start programming.

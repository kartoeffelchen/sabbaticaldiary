This is **not** a food blog but eating budae jjigae (army stew) is today's hightlight.

You can read more about the history of budae jjigae on wikipedia. Essentially, budae jjigae is a hot pot consists of spam (canned luncheon meat), hotdog sausages, baked beans, kimchi (fermented cabbage), instant noodles and gochujang (fermented chilli paste) in a soup that is mainly spicy, salty but also a little bit sour. It is one of those dishes which it is hard to imagine what it tastes if you just look at the ingredient list. It is possibly one of my favourite Korean dish.

This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRDRShaiBY0"> video </a> is quite funny but also captures nicely the reaction when trying budae jjiage for the first time - I certainly remembered how I was surprised by the combination of flavour when I tried it for the first time too!

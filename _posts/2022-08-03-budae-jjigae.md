This is **not** a food blog but eating budae jjigae (army stew) is today's hightlight.

You can read more about the history of budae jjigae on wikipedia. Essentially, budae jjigae is a hot pot consists of spam (canned luncheon meat), hotdog sausages, baked beans, kimchi (fermented cabbage), instant noodles and gochujang (fermented chilli paste) in a soup that is mainly spicy, salty but also a little bit sour. It is one of those dishes which it is hard to imagine what it tastes if you just look at the ingredient list. It's one of my favourite Korean dish which, unfortunately, not many Korean restaurants in the U.K. serve them. Maybe it is too spicy / too strange for English taste.

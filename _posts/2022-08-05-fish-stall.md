Family business brought us to Ealing, London for an overnight trip. Before we returned to Cambridge, we stopped at Wing Yip restaurant and supermarket complex in Cricklewood to have dim sum lunch with my brother's family and to do some food shopping in the supermarket. I especially like the fish stall in the supermarket, which sells fish and live lobsters, just like the fish stalls in Hong Kong.

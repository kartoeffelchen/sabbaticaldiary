Not only shall I miss my parents, I shall also miss my best friend and her daughter when I am in Munich. What are the chances of having a friend who went to the same kindergarten and secondary school in Hong Kong as I did, studied in England at the same time, and coincidentally settled down in Cambridge? 

I paid them a visit today but I didn't take a photo - so here is one from a few months ago. The two-year-old is always curious to play with things she has not seen before - in this case - walking around in my trainers.

Martin forgot to return his keys to the porters at the end of his tenure as a fellow at Corpus and I offered to drop them off for him. The porter remembered him from as an undergraduate (he has worked as a porter for around 20 years)! (I hope it wasn't because Martin caused lots of trouble back then!)

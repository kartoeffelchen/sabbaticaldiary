We dropped by Chartham to visit a friend on our way to Folkestone. She has an adorable 6-month-old baby boy and a charming cat. This is her cat, who likes sleeping under the roof on top of the suitcases that are placed above a tall cupboard, so you cannot see her easily, but she can see you from above.

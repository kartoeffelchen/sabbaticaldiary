The entire journey from Cambridge to Munich is km long, but we will first go to Martin's parents home for a long weekend. Our preferred route to go to southern Germany is to take a ferry from Harwich to Hook of Holland and drive south. We set off at 6 am this morning to catch the ferry. After arriving at Hook of Holland after 5 pm, we drove to Nijmegen, which is not far from the German border.

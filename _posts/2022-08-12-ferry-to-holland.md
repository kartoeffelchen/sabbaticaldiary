The total driving distance from Cambridge to Munich is about 990 km (615 miles) (plus the ride on the ferry from Harwich to Hook of Holland), but we will go to Martin's parents for a long weekend first before going to Munich. 

We set off at 6 am this morning to catch the ferry. It took 7 hours to reach Hook of Holland. We then drove across the Netherlands and stayed overnight in Nijmegen, which is not far from the German border.

I was hoping to take a photo of the woods on the hill behind Martin's parents, but we didn't manage to get to the woods because I was chased and bitten by a horsefly at the bottom of the hill.

At the bottom of the hill there are several corn fields. We think the corn are grown for either feeding the animals or for making biofuels.

I was hoping to take a photo of the woods on the hill behind Martin's parents, but we didn't manage to get to the woods because I was chased and bitten by a horsefly at the bottom of the hill. Instead, you will get a photo of the corn fields at the bottom of the hill. We think the corn are grown for either feeding the animals or for making biofuels.

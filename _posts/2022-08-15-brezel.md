These iconic breads which are called pretzels in English are called Brezel in German. These are common in both Swabia (the region in southwest Germany where Martin came from) and Bavaria (the region in southeast Germany where Munich is the capital). However, the Swabian version is nicer than the Bavarian version because it is not uniform in the thickness and texture: the Swabian version has a fat belly that is soft and a thin twist that is crispy. I have not mastered how to make these at home yet, so I shall get these from the bakery for now.

Here we go! We moved into our flat in Munich today. The flat is in an excellent location: under 10 minutes walk to the nearest metro stop in one direction, and under 10 minutes walk to the Englisher Garten (English Garden, one of the largest inner-city parks in the world) in the other direction. One of Martin's brothers, who lives on the other side of the Englisher Garten, visited us and we went to one of the beer gardens inside the park for a drink and an evening meal.

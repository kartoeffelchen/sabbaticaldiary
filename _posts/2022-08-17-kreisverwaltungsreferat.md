In Germany, if you arrive to take up residency (e.g. to work, to study), you must go to a government office to register within a week of arrival. In Munich, this is done in an office called Kreisverwaltungsreferat. 

Thanks to Brexit, we will have to come here again for at least another three times: once to get my visa so I can stay in Germany for more than three months, once to register our car to get a German number plate, and once when we leave Munich to move back to Cambridge.

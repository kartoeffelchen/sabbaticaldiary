This is a poster on a supermarket trolley. The heading: speediness at the till. The sentences underneath: if you have to wait for more than 5 minutes at the till when not all the tills are open, the supermarket will give you a â‚¬2.50 voucher. 

The supermarket cashiers are very efficient and they do not wait for you to pack your items before they start serving the next customer.

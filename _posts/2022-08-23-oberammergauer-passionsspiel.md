The villagers in Oberammergau put on a passion play (the events which start from Jesus entering Jerusalm on Palm Sunday and ends on Jesus dying on the cross) every decade for centuries. You may want to look up wikipedia if you are interested in the origin of the passion play in Oberammergau. The most recent play was originally scheduled for 2020 but due to the corona pandemic, it was postponed to 2022. We watched the 5.5 hours long play today in this theatre.

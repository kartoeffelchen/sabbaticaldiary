I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and struggle to get back to sleep. Normally at this time of the year I will be thinking about the start of the academic year. Instead, I am thinking about all the things we still need to get sorted. Thanks to Brexit we have to do extra things: 

* getting health insurance
* registering doctors
* getting my visa
* swapping our UK driving licences to German driving licences
* registering the car
* and other things like car insurance, home insurance, liability insurance, sim cards etc... 

This morning Martin spent an hour phoning doctors but we got nowhere as many medical practices are not accepting new patients.

We sometimes do wonder if the move is worthwhile.

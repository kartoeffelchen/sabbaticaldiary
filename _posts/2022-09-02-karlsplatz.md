I was in Karlsplatz today to register a doctor. When I came here several years ago in December, there was a ice-skate ring and the pedestrian zone behind Karlsplatz was the Christmas market in Munich.

Germans really give you the impression that they follow rules strictly and therefore at times, inflexible. For example, the doctor's policy is that no one other than the patient can enter the practice, due to Corona virus. I was hoping Martin could come with me to do the translation or give explanations if needed, but everyone has to follow the rules so there are no exceptions made for me. 

In addition, I had to navigate the challenge of seeing a doctor without the health insurance card and explaining everything to the doctor's clark in German. Fortunately, the doctor spoke really good English, so it was not a problem to go on my own.

After the appointment, I rewarded myself with a big bowl of pho (Vietnamese rice noodles with beef in a broth) and a long afternoon nap as my brain was fried.

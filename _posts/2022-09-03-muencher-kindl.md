While walking in town today I saw a manhole cover with the city's coat of arm, the Münchner Kindl, literally "Munich child". Originally the figure was a monk, because the name München meant "bei den Mönchen" (at the monks), referring to the fact that near where the city was founded there was a Benedictine monastry. At some point the figure was changed to a child wearing a hood and holding an oath book. You can see this coat of arm on the city halls and also on the metro trains.

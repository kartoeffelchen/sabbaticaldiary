The proximity from the Alps brings rain to Munich. We were told that it has been a dry summer here in Munich too, but there have been some rain and thunderstorms since we arrived and the streams parallel to the River Isar are burbling. We often can see fish in the streams (I am guessing they are roach as they have red fins).

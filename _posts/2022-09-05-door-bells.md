We live in a block of flats, but the one thing that we find very odd in Munich (and generally in Germany) is that there are no flat numbers. I can see both pros and cons: if you know the person you are looking for but not the flat number, you can find that easily on the door bell. On the other hand, we have had parcels not delivered to us because we do not have our names on the door bell yet. Likewise, letter boxes only have names. It must be pretty inefficient for the postman to find the letter box for a particular person (there are 80 letter boxes in our building).

Of course, when we first moved in two weeks ago, we put our names on a label on the door bell, but someone kept removing that label. We initially thought it was done by the property management, until a few days ago we noticed a new label stuck next to one of the door bells:

"Dear neighbours, please be so kind and let us stick our names (on the door bell). It has been agreed with the property management. Many thanks."

I think there must be someone who is very keen to keep the block of flats tidy, including the door bells.

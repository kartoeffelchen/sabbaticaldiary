Which bread roll and cake should I get this time? A question that I always have to ask myself at the bakery. 

<img src="/sabbaticaldiary/images/2022-09-06-2.jpg" alt="plum cake" class="center">

The best cake to get during this time of year is Zwetschgendatschi - a cake that is made of plums that are similar to damsons cut into slices and placed on top of a thin yeast dough. I am sure the amount of plums you get on a slice of this cake will count as one of your 5-a-day.

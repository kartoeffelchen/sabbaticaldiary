I visited the public swimming pool near my flat for the first time today. It has an indoor swimming area for adults and young children, and an outdoor massage pool. The main pool even has a wave machine to generate waves at regular intervals! (This is the only one that does that in Munich.) Lots of children had fun when the wave machine was operated. It's the last week of their summer holiday (different states in Germany start their summer holiday at different times between July and September to avoid overcrowding; the southern states of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and Bavaria are the last two states to start and end the summer holiday, compared to the rest of Germany).

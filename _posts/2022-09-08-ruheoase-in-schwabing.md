Today's post title is borrowed from the offical Munich city website to describe this lake, which is not far from where we live: Ruheoase in Schwabing, the quiet, peaceful oasis in the borough of Schwabing. It was rather nice to get some fresh air after spending an afternoon thinking about my programming problem.

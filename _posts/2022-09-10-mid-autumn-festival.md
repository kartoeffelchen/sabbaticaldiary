It is mid-autumn festival today, one of the most important festivals in Chinese culture. Families and friends will gather together to have a meal and look at the moon. It is about celebrating reunions. Sadly, we are unable to have a meal with my parents and my brother's family this year. However, we will be back in Cambridge next week so we may just have to celebrate a week later.

I wish you all a happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

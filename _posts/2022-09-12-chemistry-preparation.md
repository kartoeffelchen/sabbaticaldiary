First time thinking about A-level Chemistry since July as I prepared for tomorrow's online tuition. It's been a while since I last used Google Meet and Jamboard to do an online lesson so I had to do a trial run. It gave me painful memories of remote schooling - especially how much I hated Jamboard back then and how I *still* hate Jamboard now!

Do I miss teaching Chemistry? I don't know - yes in a way because I miss the interactions with my students and colleagues, and I know what to expect in my job because I have the experience. At the same time, since moving to Munich, I am constantly putting myself out of my comfort zone, and although at times I get frustrated, I get very excited if I manage to achieve something (be it communicating in German or getting the few lines of codes working). 

In all, the first month of living in Germany has been a positive one.

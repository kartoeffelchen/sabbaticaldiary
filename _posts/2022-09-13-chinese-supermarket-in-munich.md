There is a chain of Chinese supermarkets, which have branches in many big cities all over Germany, including here in Munich. They stock a good selection of fresh produce, dry and frozen food, from China as well as Korea, Japan and Thailand. I come here whenever I pass the area to stock up on fresh tofu.

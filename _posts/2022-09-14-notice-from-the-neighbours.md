Every now and then we see notices posted by the neighbours on the door. They are usually things like 'has anyone seen my parcel' or 'does anyone want to rent a garage'. Yesterday, a new poster appeared. I found it amusing, but Martin commented the tone was aggressive. (Germans can be funny but also very direct.)

Here is the rough translation: To the car owner of BMW X1† 
The next time the car alarm sounds during the night after 10 pm (literally "horn concert" on the notice), the police will be informed and the BMW will possibly be towed away. Park your car with the defect somewhere else, where no one sleeps, or note the above consequence.

The Oktoberfest is fast approaching and the department stores are displaying clothes you may want to wear for the 2-weeks long festival: Trachten. These are traditional folk clothes that were originally worn by the rural families, which became fashionable in the 19th and early 20th century, then adopted by the Nazis as a symbol of German heritage, fell out of fashion after the war, but in the last 20 years were revived again as Germans looked for something to represent their identities, but with less nationalistic association than in the past. The younger generations now wear them as they go to festivals like Oktoberfest and Christmas markets in Munich. Men wear <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lederhosen>Lederhosen</a>. Women wear <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirndl>Dirndl</a>.

I am mostly fascinated by the modern design like this one. To an untrained pairs of eyes it looks like just a dress with a blouse, but if you know what a traditional Dirndl looks like, then you will realise it is a modern style. It is high-end fashion: it costs an astonishing amount of around â‚¬800-900 to get the whole set (jacket, blouse, dress and tights).

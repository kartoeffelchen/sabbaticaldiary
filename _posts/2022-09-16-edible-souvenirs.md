The food department in the department store is selling edible souvenirs to celebrate Oktoberfest: chocolates (some have pictures of Edelweiss flowers printed on the packaging but these flowers can never been seen in Munich city), Lebkuchenherz (the heart shaped gingerbread biscuits with messages written on it - more intended for hanging up as a decoration than eating), beer from the largest breweries in Munich, Weißwurst (white sausages) in tins, Bavarian sweet mustard (to eat it with the Weißwurst), and marzipans made in the shape of Weißwurst or Breze (pretzel).

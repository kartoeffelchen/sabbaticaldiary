We got up at 5:30 am this morning to take the train from Munich to Cambridge (stopping at Stuttgart, Paris and London along the way). Flying would have been much quicker, but we find travelling by trains more relaxing and because it has lower greenhouse gas emission, it is worth taking longer to travel.

The photo of my feathery visitors from last year.

***

The few things I wish I could take from our home in Cambridge to Munich are:
* the firm mattress (in theory we can get a new one in Munich but I donâ€™t know what to do with it afterwards)
* the sofa and the chairs (all the things I can sit on in the flat are either too soft, too deep or too high for me)
* the heat recovery unit (I will write about how Germans ventilate their flats in future; there is a long German word to describe this specific method and we have a clause in our lease on this)
* the bird feeders and the feathery friends that visit regularly (although I can try to set up a feeder on the balcony in the flat to attract some birds)

However, it is still better to have it furnished with furniture that does not suit my taste than having no furniture at all!

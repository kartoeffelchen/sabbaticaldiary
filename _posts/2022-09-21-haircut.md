One of the important jobs that I need to do when I am back in Cambridge is to get a haircut. It is already difficult to find a hairdresser that knows how to cut Chinese hair, let alone to describe how I want my hair cut in German! Language courses only teach you words like ‘hairdresser’, ‘I get a haircut’ but not words related to hairstyle. Martin cannot help me either (he has never been to a hairdresser because his mother cut his hair before he let his hair grew long, and now I am only allowed to cut an inch to remove the split ends).

P.S. My mum's neighbour grew the pumpkin for her and it is huge!

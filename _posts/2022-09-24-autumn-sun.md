A lovely sunny morning in Trumpington. At Hobson's Park Bird Reserve I saw a heron, little egret and four swans flying over my head. When we first moved to Trumpington, we could walk to the edge of the lake and chased the geese. Therefore, we always refer to this nature reserve as 'where the geese are'. However, you cannot run to the edge of the lake anymore since they have now got a ditch and reeds around the lake. It is probably better for the birds that way.

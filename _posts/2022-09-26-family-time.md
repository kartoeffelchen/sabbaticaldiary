It is the last day of my holiday in Cambridge. I have made very good use of my time to visit my parents and Anne's family. I also bought a few things to take back to Munich: Martin's brother, Philipp has requested Maltesers chocolate and I need to get a peg dryer for hanging socks because I cannot get them in Germany! And I have a much-needed break from using German daily ;-). I feel refreshed and look forward to my routine of programming, German practice, cello playing and swimming when I am back in Munich.

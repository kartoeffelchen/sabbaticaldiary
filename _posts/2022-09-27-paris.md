Passing through Paris on my way back to Munich. Usually we take the shortest route between Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est stations, but I now like to go on a slightly longer route that take me past an indoor market (Marché couvert Saint-Quentin) because I like to look at market stalls.

This time I can take a direct train from Paris to Munich without changing in Stuttgart. The whole journey takes about 5 hours 30 minutes. I am prepared with water, snacks, and takeaway Japanese food to eat on the train.

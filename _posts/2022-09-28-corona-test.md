I have not paid much attention on Covid-19 infection figures anymore, partly because in the U.K. all the Covid-19 restrictions were lifted back in February this year and life has returned to normal. Interestingly, there are still a few restrictions in Germany, and yesterday the local news reported about the rising figures of Covid-19 infection in Munich. 

One example of restrictions that are still in place is 'Maskepflicht' (duty to wear a medical or FFP2 mask) on public transport. Yesterday as I took the train from Paris to Munich, as soon as the train crossed the French border to enter Germany, the railway staff made announcement about mask wearing on the train, and everyone who didn't wear a mask while the train was travelling in France put on a mask for the rest of the journey. (Germans are good at obeying rules.) I understand they cannot implement the rule while in France, though I do question the effectiveness of such measure. How much difference does it make when you spend two hours on the train without a mask and three hours with a mask?

Another example is lateral flow test. Visitors going to the doctor's or hospital need to do a lateral flow test at a pharmacy or corona test station, though the test is free. However, I am not sure if the patient themselves need to do a test - at least I did not get asked about this when I went to the doctor's, but Martin who came to the appointment with me had to do a lateral flow test, showed the test certificate to the receptionist, who then made a record of his details. He had to even wait outside the practice until my actual appointment with the doctor, while I waited in the waiting room. 

I do support mask wearing on public transport and doing lateral flow tests, though I find what I have experienced illogical.

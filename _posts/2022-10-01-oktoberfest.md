We went to the Oktoberfest today! There are many beer tents, rides, food stalls and a small number of souvenir stalls.

We went onto the swing ride and while on the ride, we could get an aerial view of the beer tents and stalls, as well as the church towers in the city centre and even as far as the Alps (however, I didn't dare to take out my phone to take a photo in case I dropped my phone).

We also went to a flea circus, which according to this <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2LF04Y9n5hJTHK1l6ffLhPc/the-rise-and-demise-of-the-flea-circus"> article </a>, it's the only place in the world where you can still see a flea circus.

By mid-day the beer tents were already pretty full; there were bands playing live music and lots of people drinking beer and eating. As it started raining in the afternoon, we left the Oktoberfest and seeked shelter in a museum.

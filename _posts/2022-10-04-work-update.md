As it is the first working day in October, I should do an update on my work:
since August I have been using JavaScript to write a web-based program to draw molecules. In the program, you can drag out copies of carbon and hydrogen atoms and draw lines between them to represent the bonds. You can also drag the individual atoms to move them around. 

To improve the program further, I had to rewrite the program to render the drawing.

Currently, I am working on the layout of a complete molecule, where I need to show the correct bond lengths and bond angles between the atoms. 

The main things I have learnt in the last two months are:
* using TypeScript to write my program;
* using arrays and objects and the functions that are available to them;
* using svg to draw things.

Admittedly, I would like to make faster progress (though sometimes the body does not cooperate). However, I am proud of what I have achieved so far and that I manage to do everything with very little help from Martin.

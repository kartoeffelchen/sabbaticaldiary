Feeling unwell so I am housebound today (otherwise I would have gone out for a routine check at the doctor's and to visit a piano shop).

Here are some photos of our flat. It is very spacious (uncommon in big cities), bright and as it is south-facing, we can get sunlight in the living room throughout the day. However, there are no window shutters so we do not know how cold it will get in winter and how hot it will get in summer.

Sometimes the day just disappears quickly. I spent a while thinking about my programming problem but got nowhere, doing housework such as vacuuming and cooking, playing the cello, and that was pretty much my day. 

We went for a walk just after sunset. Some of the paths were not lit (energy saving in Germany?) but as it was not too dark still, we could see the paths illuminated by the moon and the Mini-Hofbräuhaus (a tiny beer garden in the middle of Englisher Garten).

My mother-in-law, Rita, has kindly lent us a shopping trolley so we can go to the supermarket without a car.

One thing we must remember in Germany is not to jaywalk even if there is no traffic on the road. If you jaywalk in front of parents with young children, they will tell you off for setting a bad example (Martin said it has happened to him before).

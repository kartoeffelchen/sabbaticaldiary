As the weather was nice this morning, we decided to go to the Olympic Park for a walk. When we were at the Olympic Stadium, we saw lots of people in Lederhosen with bib numbers walking around - apparently today was 'Trachtenlauf' - the participants can wear their traditional costumes (apart from Lederhosen, I also saw kimonos) to go for a fun run; when they finish the run, they get a Bavarian breakfast (a pair of white sausages, a brezel and an alcohol-free wheat beer) and a Lebkuchenherz (gengerbread) as a souvenir.

Our adventure started this morning: we almost could not get our car out because the organiser for the Munich marathon closed off the road where we parked - but there were no warnings about road closure beforehand! Luckily, after negotiating with one of the staff and the police, we could leave the road to set off to Walchensee.

Walchensee is one of the lakes that lie south of Munich. It takes just over an hour to get there by car. After we reached the lake, we took a cable car to the top of the mountain, had lunch at the restaurant at the top and followed the path to climb up for another 200 m to reach the summit, Herzogstand. On a clear day we would see the two lakes in the area and also the other peaks further away. Today was cloudy on the north side of Herzogstand but relatively clear on the south side of the mountain, so one of the lakes was visible. We also enjoyed the shades of yellow and brown from the deciduous trees lower down on the hillside and by the lake.

On our way home, we stopped at the visitor centre at a hydroelectric power station (Walchenseekraftwerk). There were some excellent explanations and models to show the different types of turbines and generation of hydroelectricity, and we could also see the water pipes leading to the turbine hall and go inside the turbine hall.

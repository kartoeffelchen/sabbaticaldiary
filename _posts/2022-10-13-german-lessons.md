I also started an online conversation class at the Münchner Volkshochschule, which provides adult education. Unfortunately the Münchner Volkshochschule does not have eye-catching advertisements in the metro like this, which would be more appropriate as a photo for today's entry. 

One of the topics that was briefly discussed in the conversation class was integration, a topic that is often talked about in Germany. I do think being able to speak the language fluently is only the start; there is also embracing the culture and making friends with the locals which can sometimes be very hard. One Greek girl in the class said she has been living and working in Munich for 6 years, but she still does not feel fully integrated here. It is sad as I can sense her dispair and self-doubt if this really is the place for her.

There are many really good chocolate to choose from in Germany. We do love Ritter Sport but there are other brands like Lindt, Hachez, Heilemann and Niederegger too. However, we now find the standard Ritter Sport a bit too sweet (change of taste) and prefer their Kakaoklasse line with 61% or 74% cocoa content.

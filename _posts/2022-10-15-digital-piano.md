We went to a piano shop (Piano Eberl) to hire a digital piano today. The shop is near Ostfriedhof in south-eastern Munich, an area which we do not normally go to. The moment we got off the tram I realised we were right next to the hotel we stayed in our first visit in Munich in December 2015 (though I could not remember its name nor location until today). 

The man that ran the piano shop was very friendly and we could even arrange for a same-day delivery! We can finally do some piano playing again.

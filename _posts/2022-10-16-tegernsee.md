We drove to Tegernsee as the weather was fantastic! From the southern side of the lake we could take a cable car to the top of Wallberg and walked for a little bit to the summit. From there we could see the lake and Munich from a distance when we looked north, and numerous peaks in the Alps in Germany and Austria if we looked south. Of course, we finished the walk with lunch at the restaurant before going back downhill on the cable car. This is what I can currently manage without putting too much strain on my knees or hurting my back. It will probably be our last trip to the mountains until May next year.

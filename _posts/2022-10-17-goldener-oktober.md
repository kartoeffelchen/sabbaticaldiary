My mother-in-law introduced me the term 'Goldener Oktober' (golden October). In meteorology, it refers to the period around middle October when the sun shines and the temperature can reach more than 20 degrees, due to stable high pressure systems over middle and eastern Europe. The maximum temperature for both yesterday and today reached 22 áµ’C.

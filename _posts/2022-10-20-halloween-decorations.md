This is the first time I have seen Halloween decorations in Germany. I have only seen a small selection of Halloween items on sale in some supermarkets. Perhaps Halloween is not catching on in Germany yet, but I do wonder if that will be the case in 5 or 10 yearsâ€™ time, especially with more American programs being available through online streaming these days and there are many people who  consider American culture as cool.

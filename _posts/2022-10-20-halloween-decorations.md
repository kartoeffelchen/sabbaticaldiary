This is the first time I have seen Halloween decorations in Germany. I have only seen a small selection of Halloween items on sale in some supermarkets. According to the teacher in my German conversational course, Halloween became popular since the Harry Potter series were introduced to Germany. I do wonder if it will become commercialised like in England in the next decade.

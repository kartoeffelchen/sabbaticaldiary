Admittedly, this is not the best photo in the diary, but if you look carefully enough you may see a large grey bird and a small bright blue bird in this photo. We saw both birds at Schwabinger See, as we were walking from the supermarket back to our flat.

The grey bird is a female goosander (I have only seen a goosander once when I was on holiday in the Yorkshire Dales).

The bright blue bird is a kingfisher. We happened to see a bright blue object flying onto a branch and we knew instantly it was a kingfisher.

The northern part of the Englisher Garten has lots of flowing streams and small lakes - it is very peaceful here. At the end of the walk, we rewarded ourselves by visiting the Aumeister Biergarten to have a grilled sausage, sauerkraut and potato salad.

One thing we noticed on our walk today: the dogs that go on a walk with their owners are always very well-behaved. They rarely bark at other dogs or people, leave you alone when you walk past them, and they respond swiftly to the owners' call. This is quite different from what I have experienced in England (on numerous occasions I had dogs barking at me or jumping up; the worse experience was once while we were having a picnic with our friends and their children, a large dog ran towards my friend's toddler son and grabbed a sandwich from his plate! The owners did not even apologise!).

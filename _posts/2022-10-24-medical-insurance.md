It has been a real pain to sout out the medical insurance in Germany. 

The first time we submitted our application on paper before we arrived in Munich, they claimed they never received it (presumably it got lost somewhere), so when we arrived, we found ourselves not insured. (I also don’t know why they don’t accept the form digitally but I have the impression many administration and registration are still done on paper in Germany. I was once at the KVR, a local government office, to fill in something on paper, then saw the clerk typed it into the computer and shredded the form.) 

The second time we sent them the application, they claimed they did not receive a copy of our wedding certificate even though we had sent it to them. Somehow they also lost Martin’s photo but not mine. 

After fixing all of these, we finally received our medical insurance cards late September, but I only found out last week (my fault for not checking carefully) that my first name and surname on their system were the wrong way round, even though it was correct on our form. However, I was also very surprised that I could just log onto my account and change it without showing them any official identification such as passport or ID card. 

Anyway, we have now fixed all the problems after two months.

We have decided to take the car back to Cambridge because it is too much hassle to keep our car in Munich (we would have to swap our driving licences, deregister the car in the UK and register in Germany, get winter tyres for driving in the winter months, take the car to a charging station from time to time and find street parking). The public transport in Munich is excellent and if we do need the car for a day, we may be able to borrow Philipp's car.

Today we set off to visit my parents-in-law and stay with them overnight, before doing the long drive tomorrow. 

Close to where they live, there is a field where in summer you can cut your own flowers. In autumn, they have a roadside stall where you can pick the pumpkin you like.

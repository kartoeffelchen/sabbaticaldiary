We stayed in a hotel close to Kalkar not far from the Dutch/German border. The hotel is truly in a place that can be described by the German expression 'wo Fuchs und Hase sich Gute Nacht sagen' (literally: where fox and hare say good night to each other - i.e. a very quiet place).

While driving from the hotel to the Netherlands, we saw lots of geese on the meadows! Every autumn a large number of geese arrive from Scandanavia to spend their winter in that part of the Netherlands and Germany.

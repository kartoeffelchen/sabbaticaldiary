Yesterday in Kalkar we bought a Weckmann but as we didn't finish it, we had the rest today for breakfast. Weckmann is a sweet yeast dough that is shaped into a man and often has a pipe in its mouth. It has many different names depending on the region and according to Wikipedia, you can get it around 11th November (St Martin's Day) or around 6th December (St Nicholas Day).

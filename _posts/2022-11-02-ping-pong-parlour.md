I think shopping centres are less common in Germany than here in the U.K. - what you tend to get are pedestrianised shopping streets in city centres. (Can you imagine no traffic in Regent Street and Oxford Street?!) I have noticed that because there are more vacant shops in shopping centres in Cambridge especially since the Covid pandemic, the management turns the shops into other uses to increase the footfall, e.g. pop-up exhibitions or galleries. Recently, I spotted a ping-pong (table tennis) parlour inside a shopping centre, where you can play ping-pong free!

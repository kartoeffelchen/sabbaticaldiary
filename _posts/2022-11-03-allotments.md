A few of my mum's neighbours have allotments; she often comes here to help them to water the plants and in return, she can get some of their produce. It is nice to see her making friends in the neighbourhood. 

I only find out today that allotments in Germany have strict rules that meant you can only: grow fruits and vegetables on a third of the area, do garden design (e.g. grow a lawn) on a third of the area and build a path or a summer house or a terrace on the remaining third of the area.

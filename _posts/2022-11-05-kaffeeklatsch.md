'Kaffeeklatsch' means meeting up someone for a chat over a cup of coffee. Obviously, while in Cambridge I had to have a Kaffeeklatsch with Anne my best friend (unfortunately I forgot to take a photo so I have to substitute with a photo of where we used to go for walks before she moved out of Cambridge to a small village). It will be the last quiet brunch we can have together for a while!

It is Armistice Day in the U.K.. In Germany, it is St Martin’s Day. Children in kindergartens make their own lanterns and go for a parade with their lit lanterns. Unfortunately, I didn’t encounter any (probably because I was out during the wrong time of the day) - so instead here is a photo of a foggy evening.

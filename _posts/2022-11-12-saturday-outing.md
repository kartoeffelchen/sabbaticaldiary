While going for a walk in the Englisher Garten today, we saw a group of people (adults with their children) playing some ball games. The parents were pulling their carts, which normally were for transporting children, along the paths. Instead, they were fully loaded with beer bottles and Lebkuchen (gingerbread biscuits). What a lovely way for friends to spend a Saturday afternoon together.

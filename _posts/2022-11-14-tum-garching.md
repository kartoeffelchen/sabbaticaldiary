Due to some ongoing maintenance work in our building, there is no water supply in our flat between 8 am and 5 pm. Therefore, I went to Martin’s office to work for a day. This is the view inside the computing department building - the most exciting thing is the slide going from the third floor to the ground floor (rugs are provided for riding the slides). Unfortunately, I don’t think it is a good idea for me to try the slide at the moment.

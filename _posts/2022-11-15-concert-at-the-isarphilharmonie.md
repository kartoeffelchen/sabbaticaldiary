We want to make use of the opportunities to watch concerts while we still can - this evening we went to the Isarphilharmonie (one of the main concert venues in Munich) to watch Sol Gabetta playing Shostakovichâ€™s Cello Concerto No. 1 with the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra. Sol Gabetta's playing was excellent anyway, but what I also found it interesting is to hear the phrasing and articulations which I sometimes miss out when listening to the recordings.

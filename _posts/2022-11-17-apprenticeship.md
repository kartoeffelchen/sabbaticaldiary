The advertisement you see on public transport can give you a clue about what people are looking for in a city. Since October, I have seen quite a few advertisements on Ausbildung (apprenticeship) from different companies or organisations. Martinâ€™s cousin, Kilian, who is in the equivalent of Year 10 in the English school system, is currently applying for a place to do his apprenticeship in his hometown after he finishes school next summer. If he gets a place, he will be employed by the company where he will continue to do some studies as well as learning on the job at his workplace, while also getting paid. Apprenticeship offers those who do not want to go onto universities an alternative but equally highly regarded pathway to a future career.

We travelled in the first class on an ICE train (intercity express) to Heidelberg today, because we got a free upgrade. We also saw two storks in a field while the train was travelling between Augsburg and Ulm. There are storks that breed in this part of Germany in summer, though I did not know some of these storks stay here over winter, as storks are migratory birds.

We went to Heidelberg to visit Martin's other younger brother, Ben. Although the weather was pretty miserable today, we played some board games together and went for a walk along the Philosophenweg (Philosopher's Way) in the rain. From there we could get a nice view of the river, the Heidelberg castle and the old town.

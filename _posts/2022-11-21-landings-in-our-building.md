As we live in a 1970s building, not only are the flats spacious, but also the landings and the stairs for going up and down. The stairs are so wide that Philipp commented they reminded him of his secondary school. On my floor several pot plants have appeared in the landing since October. I suspect one of the neighbours keeps them in their balcony in the warmer months but as it is getting cooler, they move them there. And how lovely that I get to see them as I get in and out of my flat without doing any gardening myself!

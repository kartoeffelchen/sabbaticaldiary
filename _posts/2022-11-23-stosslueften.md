The rental contract has a clause that requires us to perform ‘stoßlüften’ daily. This means we have to open all the windows at the same time for a short period of time, in order to create a draft of air to exchange the air from inside with the outside. This is mainly to reduce the humidity inside the flat to avoid mould growing. I must admit in days like today when it is only about 3 ᵒC in the morning, it is a little bit chilly to open the windows!

It is exactly a month before Christmas. I have decided to test making my own Elisenlebkuchen but with reduced sugar content (so either have them unglazed but they don't look as pretty - the top photo, or glazed with dark chocolate - the bottom photo). The recipe we use to make these Elisenlebkuchen comes from Martin's Oma - his German grandmother would make a huge quantity of these as well as other festive biscuits and bring them to his home when she came to stay during Christmas. This is always my favourite because it is nutty and not buttery.

Martin is out on a retreat with his work colleagues today and tomorrow. They are going to the university's own academy centre (formerly a cloister but now a conference centre) outside Munich in the mountains close to the border with Austria and listen to talks given by various members in his group.

For me, it means it's time to do some Christmas shopping! This shop (Bauer & Hieber) is the most amazing music shop I have ever been! It has a huge collection of printed music. Opposite to the music shop is Dallmayr which sells coffee, tea, chocolate and delicatessen. And not far from here is the book shop Hugendubel.

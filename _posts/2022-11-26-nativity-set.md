Although I am not a particularly religious person, I do like looking at nativity sets during the Advent and Christmas season. Obviously churches will have displays of them, but you can also see them in Christmas markets, and sometimes in shop windows. 

This one is in the Christmas market in Munich. The wooden sculptures are made by a sculptor in Oberammergau, the small village which we went to a few months ago for the Passion Play. 

I need to go back and check but I am pretty certain this display is on loan from the nativity set membership organisiation in Munich. (There are all sorts of membership organisations in Germany.)

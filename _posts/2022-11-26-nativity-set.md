Although I am not a particularly religious person, I do like looking at nativity sets during the Advent and Christmas season. Obviously churches will have displays of them, but you can also see them in Christmas markets, and sometimes in shop windows. 

This one is in the Christmas market in Munich. The wooden sculptures are made by a sculptor in Oberammergau, the small village which we went to a few months ago for the Passion Play. As to the display, it is on loan from a nativity set membership organisiation in Munich that was established back in 1917! (There are all sorts of membership organisations in Germany.)

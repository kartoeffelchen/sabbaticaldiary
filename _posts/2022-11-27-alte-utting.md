This evening after a lovely pre-concert meal at a Georgian restaurant and on our walk to the Isarphilharmonie (currently located in Gasteig HP8, a former power station in Sendling south of the city centre), we came across this boat. It was previously a steamboat that took passengers on excursions on the Ammersee (one of the lakes outside Munich). The boat now houses several food stalls and a bar. During this time of year, it also has a mini Christmas market onboard.

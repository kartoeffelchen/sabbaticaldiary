Before attending another concert at the Isarphilharmonie, we went to a Georgian restaurant. We only recently got to know about Georgian food since our visit to St Petersburg in 2019. There is always a good selection of both vegetarian and meat dishes, seasoned with an interesting mix of spices that is aromatic but not spicy. My favourite is always khinkali, Georgian dumplings. They are similar to Shanghainess Xiaolongbao in which there are meat and broth inside the dumplings, so when you eat it, you have to bite carefully and drink the broth immediately. However, the Georgian dumplings are much bigger in size so you can hold it with your hand, and you do not eat the tip of the dumpling (where the dough is so thick that it does not get cooked through). 

As for the concert, this evening was Daniil Trifonov playing Scriabin's Piano Concerto in F sharp minor with the Orchestre National de France. The orchestra also played Franck's Symphony in D minor.

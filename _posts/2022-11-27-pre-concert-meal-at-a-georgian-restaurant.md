Before attending another concert at the Isarphilharmonie, we went to a Georgian restaurant. We only recently got to know about Georgian food since our visit to St Petersburg in 2019. There is always a good selection of both vegetarian and meat dishes, seasoned with an interesting mix of spices that is aromatic but not spicy.

As for the concert, this evening was Daniil Trifonov playing Scriabin's Piano Concerto in F sharp minor with the Orchestre National de France. I chose the concert because I have heard very positive reviews of Danill Trifonov's playing, and also I didn't know all the pieces that were performed tonight.

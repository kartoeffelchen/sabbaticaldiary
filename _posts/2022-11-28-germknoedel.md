It’s Martin’s birthday today but I didn’t bake a cake this year. Instead, we had a Germknödel! This is one of my favourite southern German / Austrian sweet dish in winter (some people have it as a main dish but we usually share it as a dessert). It is a steamed yeast dough filled with plum jam inside and sprinkled ground poppy seed and sugar on top. To make it extra decadent we also put vanilla sauce. Martin says the vanilla sauce in Germany is the same as English custard, but I still think they are not the same thing (the vanilla sauce powder mix is something I have to import from Germany to England in order to make the sauce; I also use it as a filling when I make apple cake or ground poppy seed cake at home). We always have Germknödel when we go to Christmas markets, but I actually like my homemade version more than the ones I have in the Christmas markets or restaurants.

The water fountain in Karlsplatz is covered up and a temporary ice-skate ring is built on top of it. We went ice-skating here once when we were in Munich in December several years ago. Unfortunately, I have to give it a miss this year. 

My favourite ice-skate ring in Germany is the one in Zollverein in Essen: it is located in a former coking plant so the ice-skate ring is very long but narrow (good for skating very fast in a straight line). Although this year it is closed; as I read on the Guardian newspaper only last week, in order to save energy, many European cities are replacing ice-skating with roller-skating this year.

Outside the swimming pool where I go swimming twice a week, there is a telephone box which has many books inside. It is a book exchange corner where people can pick up or drop off a book. I have also seen a book exchange corner inside a shopping centre in Munich.

There may also be a similar scheme in my building as I have often noticed random objects (books, magazines and toys) being placed next to the front entrance or inside the lift - but I don't know whether the swaps are between several neighbours or open to every one, as there are no written notes or notices on them. It could well be one of those arrangements which those living in the building for a long time know about, but we as newcomers do not.

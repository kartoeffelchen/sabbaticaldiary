Late yesterday afternoon after a routine check at the doctor's, I have been advised to go into a hospital for some further checks and monitoring. The care I have received at the hospital so far has been excellent. I am relieved that communication is not a problem: the doctors speak perfect English and with the other staff such as the sisters, helpers and with the other patients in the room, I can talk to them in German. I am also very fortunate that the hospital I am staying in is only 10 minutes cycle from our flat, so Martin can easily bring me a good supply of food and come for a daily visit.

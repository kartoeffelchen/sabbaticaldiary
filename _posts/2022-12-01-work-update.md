I am pleased to present you my project, which I have been working on it since the end of July.

This is the web-based JavaScript program which I have written from scratch. In this program, you can drag the atoms into the grey area and draw bonds to connect them. When you are done and click the 'done' button, it will re-draw the molecule showing the correct bond angles. It is at a stage which does work, but there are still minor issues I need to fix. The major issue is dealing with re-drawing a molecule that has a ring structure - but I don't want to get into it at this stage as it requires a different approach to handle this case.

I am also now working through CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course and their projects. Though I am making slow progress with Project 0 as it requires using CSS and I do not particularly like CSS. One thing for certain: I do not think I want to do webpage design if I were to change my career.

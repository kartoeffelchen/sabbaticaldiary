I am pleased to present you my <a href="">project</a>, which I have been working on it since the end of July.

This is the web-based JavaScript program which I have written from scratch. In this program, you can drag the atoms into the grey area and draw bonds to connect them. As soon as a molecule is complete, it will be re-drawn showing the correct bond angles. At the moment, it only works when you use a mouse, so I need to tweak it for using it on an iPad. Also, it cannot handle re-drawing a molecule that has a ring structure - but I want to put it aside for now as it requires a different approach to handle this case.

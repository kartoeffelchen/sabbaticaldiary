I am still in the hospital - it's a real shame as my friend, Nicola, arrives from London today. She woud have stayed with us for a few nights, and we would have gone on a free walking tour of the city today and maybe visit a museum or two together. It's all thrown out of the window now. 

I am feeling positive though - I have not been too bored in the hospital as I have books to read, puzzle books to do and my laptop with me to do things.

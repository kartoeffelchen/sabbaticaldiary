It has been very quiet because I am the only person staying overnight in my three-person room. Occasionally, someone will come in as an outpatient for a minor surgery, but they come in the morning and leave by early afternoon.

The food is not too bad - breakfast is typically bread rolls with cold sausages and cheese, lunch is a hot meal and dinner is bread rolls with cold sausages and cheese - this is typical for Germans who have a hot meal for lunch and bread in the evening (Abendbrot, i.e. evening bread).

This is something that is possibly more common here in Germany than in England: the pantries have crates of bottled water (and perhaps also crates of beer or soft drinks, though not here in the hospital). Depending on whether the drinks are free, you may need to put down what you are taking on a sheet and pay afterwards. In the hospital the bottled water is free. The drinks company collects the crates of empty bottles, clean them, refill them and send them back to the hospital. There is even a choice of still water and carbonated water (which sometimes comes in two categories: more fizz and less fizz).

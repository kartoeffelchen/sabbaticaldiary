I am finally allowed to go home after spending a week at the hospital. Unfortunately, a week of bedrest and very little walking meant I have lost quite a bit of muscle strength especially on my back and legs, so even walking from the ward to the front entrance took me triple the amount of time. (This reminded me of the poster I saw in the Cambridge A&E: lying on bed for a week makes you older by 10 years - I can definitely feel the effect even I am not old!)

The front entrance of the hospital has a sundial and some mosaics - I didn't notice this last Tuesday when I arrived.

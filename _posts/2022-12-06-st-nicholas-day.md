Today is St Nicholas Day! It's a Feast Day that is celebrated widely in Germany. Children put their shoes at the front door, hoping that St Nicholas bring them fruits, nuts and chocolates (if they have been well-behaved - otherwise they get a stick).

Martin's mother sends us a St Nicholas parcel every year and it is usually filled with gingerbread (Lebkuchen), spiced biscuits (Spekulatius) or German Christmas cake (Stollen) that we cannot easily get in England (though Waitrose now stocks some Lebkuchen and Stollen). This year we request a healthier version of nuts and dried fruits. It always means a lot to us to receive a St Nicholas parcel.

There are a few small and medium size supermarkets within 10-20 minutes walk from our flat. There is also a very small grocery that is only two minutes walk from our flat. I only went there once (on the very first day we arrived as we needed some lunch), but I had been told it is very popular in the neighbourhood - it's not just a shop but also a meeting point. It is good to know that this can be my last resort for getting food if I am not very mobile.

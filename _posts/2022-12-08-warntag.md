The phone suddenly went off at 10:59 with an alarm and a message saying 'Emergency Alarm'. It was the first nationwide drill (called Warntag) to test the emergency warning system, following the catastrophe in July 2021 which many lives were lost from floodings after a very heavy rainfall. During today's test, sirens were sounded (but as there are no sirens in Munich, we didn't hear any) and messages were sent to all mobile phones to give a warning.

Today was the last online antenatal course (on Zoom); fortunately, there were no exchanges of phone numbers or setting up of WhatsApp group with other first-time parents at the end of the course (this is not surprising as privacy is very important in Germany). We felt the courses we did were helpful, but we could only tell how useful they were later! 

After attending the session this morning, we went for a walk in the Englisher Garten to look at the snow. It was so cold that the snow was dry and powdery. I love the sound when you crush the snow under your shoes as you walk.

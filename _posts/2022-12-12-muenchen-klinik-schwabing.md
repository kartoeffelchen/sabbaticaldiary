We went back to the hospital but this time to register giving birth. 

There are lots of differences in the healthcare system in Germany compared to the NHS in the U.K.. I don’t want to say which is better or worse because they are just different systems. In Germany, every one needs to have a medical insurance but you can choose either a state insurance or a private insurance. The amount of money you pay for the state insurance correlates to your income. This is similar to paying income tax and the national insurance in the U.K., which funds the NHS (as well as other things).

With the German system I can choose my own doctors - in terms of maternity care it means I have regular check-ups done by my gynaecologist, I can choose the hospital for giving birth (hence I need to do the registration now) and I can find my own midwife for postnatal care. This was a particularly stressful experience for us after we just moved to Munich because several gynaecologists and midwives we contacted did not have any availability (we were told that as soon as a woman finds out she is pregnant, she will book a midwife and even find a nursery place; when we contacted the midwives in September, the midwives were already booked until April 2023). In the U.K. once you told your GP (family doctor) that you are pregnant, the NHS will arrange the scans and midwife appointments for antenatal care and postnatal care. And unless the local hospital’s maternity unit is full, you will just turn up to the local hospital for giving birth. However, some people also sign up for a nursery immediately - we have not done that yet.

In the German system, the medical insurance also pays for my pregnancy pilates course (treated as prevention of illness), antenatal classes and exercise classes after giving birth. There are other things they will pay for such as acupuncture for pain relief, or homeopathy if you believe that it helps. Obviously in the U.K. you will have to pay for these privately, though NHS antenatal classes are free.  

As I said, they are different systems and there are pros and cons for both systems. The important thing is - I received good care in the first 3 months of my pregnancy in the U.K. and I am also receiving good care here since moving to Munich, for which I am really fortunate and immensely grateful.

I do love a stroll around Christmas markets, regardless how many times I have been to one, regardless whether they sell the same stuff or not (for food items: Bratwurst - grilled sausages, Glühwein - mulled wine, Kinderpunsch - mulled apple juice, Dampfnudeln and Germknödel - steamed bread dough without or with jam filled inside, crêpes, candied almonds; for non-food items: Christmas decorations made of straws, glass baubles, nativity figures and other handmade crafts). Each Christmas market is different: the layout, the atmosphere, the decorations, the mug for the Glühwein and Kinderpunsch. In Munich the main Christmas market in Marienplatz is very touristy, but the smaller ones like the one by the Chinesischen Turm in the Englisher Garten (unfortunately, there is none this year) or the medieval Christmas market in Wittelsbacher Platz near Odeonplatz are quite charming.

What is my favourite food in the Christmas market? Reibekuchen / Kartoeffelpuffer (fried potato pancake served with apple sauce) and Germknödel (steamed bread dough with plum jam inside served with vanilla sauce). I will also go for Kürtőskalács (Hungarian chimney cake) if I see them.

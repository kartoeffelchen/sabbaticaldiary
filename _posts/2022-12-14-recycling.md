Let's talk about recycling in Germany! 

My first conversation with a German was probably on a Lufthansa flight from London to Hong Kong via Munich. During the first leg of my journey, I sat next to a middle-aged businessman who was on his way home. Not sure how we started chatting, but I definitely remembered he was telling me about recycling and commenting on how the rubbish collected on the aeroplane were threw together into a bin and could not be recycled. Somehow that made an impression on me - Germans really care about recycling!

In my first visit to Martin's home I was made aware of where to put the different types of rubbish: paper and cardboard go into one box, plastic waste go into another box, glass jars and bottles are put on the side and the rest of the rubbish go into the kitchen bin. The black wheelie bin for putting rubbish that gets taken to the landfill is relatively small for a large house - this is delibrate to encourage more recycling.

Here in Munich, suprisingly, the city does not have 'gelbe Tonne / gelbe Sack' (yellow wheelie bin or large yellow plastic bags for collecting items for recycling). Instead, there are these large bins around the block where you have to take your recycling there. There are separate large bins for collecting glass bottles or jars. And you do not put glass bottles or jars into the one for plastic waste (and vice versa) - otherwise, you commit 'recycling sin' as Martin joked one day - he accidentally threw the glass jar into the plastic bin because we were used to the system in Cambridge where everything that can be recycled (paper, cardboard, plastic and glass) go into the same blue bin.

Apparently, in Munich the city is finally piloting the collection of household recyclable items in January 2024.

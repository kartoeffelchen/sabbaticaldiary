This was the first time we ate out in a German restaurant since moving to Munich and we had a classic dish: grilled pork served with bread and potato dumplings, and red cabbage. Martin also ordered an alcohol-free beer. The bread dumplings are made from soaking stale bread pieces in milk, seasoned with herbs and spices, and shaped into ball shapes. (It's a good way of using up stale bread!) The potato dumplings are made from mixing cooked potato with potato starch, again seasoned with herbs and spices, and shaped into ball shapes. Both types of dumplings are cooked in a pot of water. 

After dinner, we watched another concert - this time it was Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra playing Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra and Walton's Viola Concerto with Tabea Zimmermann; it was a great concert but the first encore piece which Tabea Zimmermann played was especially impressive - we had no idea what it was called but she demonstrated her virtuosic techniques in the piece. It is a shame that the viola is often seen as less superior than the violin; it actually has a really rich sound in the lower register and sings as beautifully as the violin in the higher register.

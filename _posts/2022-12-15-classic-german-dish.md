This was the first time we ate out in a German restaurant since moving to Munich and we had a classic dish: grilled pork served with bread and potato dumplings, and red cabbage. Martin also ordered an alcohol-free beer. The bread dumplings (Semmelknödel) are made from soaking stale bread pieces in milk, seasoned with herbs and spices, and shaped into balls. (It's a fantastic way of using up stale bread!) The potato dumplings (Kartoffelknödel) are made from mixing cooked potato with potato starch, again seasoned with herbs and spices, and shaped into balls. Both types of dumplings are cooked in a pot of water and are usually served with grilled meat with gravy. 

After dinner, we watched another concert - this time it was Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra playing Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra and Walton's Viola Concerto with Tabea Zimmermann as the soloist; if playing a viola concerto was not exhausting enough, she played two technically demanding pieces for the encore (Paul Hindemith's Sonata for Viola Solo and Henri Vieuxtemps' Capriccio for Viola Solo). It is a shame that the viola is often seen as less superior than the violin; it actually has a really warm and rich sound in the lower register and sings as beautifully as the violin in the higher register.

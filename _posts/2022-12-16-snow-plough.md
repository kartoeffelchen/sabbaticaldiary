We had more snow today and several snow ploughs were in action, clearing the snow on pavements and streets. In private buildings, the owners are responsible for clearing the snow on pavements in front of their properties - in our case, the Hausmeister (caretaker for the building) deals with it. While walking or driving were not treacherous, I was impressed how cyclists continued to cycle - this included the postman who continued to deliver posts and parcels on his bike (possibly because he had no other options)!

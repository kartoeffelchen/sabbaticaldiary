There is a Saturday farmers' market next to the Nordfriedhof metro station. There are around 10 stalls, selling vegetables, fruits and meat produced from farms in Bavaria. We occasionally visit the stalls as you can get items that you would not normally find in a supermarket, for example, ostrich meat from an ostrich farm, or different varieties of apples.

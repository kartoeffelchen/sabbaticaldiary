We travelled to Bamberg today for a mini-holiday (trendsetters would call this a babymoon). Bamberg is located just over 200 km north of Munich and is easily accessible by ICE trains. It is recognised by UNESCO as a town that has preserved many religious and secular buildings which date back to the early Medival period. The old town retained many half-timbered houses which had rich Baroque fa√ßade and fresco decorations (which was popular in the 17th century). I am sure it has an interesting history although I couldn't manage to do a guided tour.

The Altes Rathaus, old town hall, which dates back to the 14th century, was built on a reclaimed island because the bishop of Bamberg didn't want to give any land for the citizens to build the town hall - so they had to resort to making a reclaimed island in the middle of the river.

The Bamberger Dom, cathedral, is just over 1000 years old. It was built with a mixture of Gothic and Romanesque architecture styles.

Behind the old port of Bamberg is a row of houses that used to belong to the fishermen.

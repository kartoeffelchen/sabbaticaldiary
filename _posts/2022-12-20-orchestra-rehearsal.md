Martin's friend from school has an younger brother (Wolfi) who plays the viola in the Bamberger Symphoniker. The orchestra is one of the best in Germany and is especially well-known in East Asia. We thought if we are living in Munich, we should at least come to Bamberg to hear the orchestra (hence the trip to Bamberg) - what's more, we managed to ask him to take us to one of the their rehearsals. 

We watched their third rehearsal, in which the guest conductor, Andris Nelsons, was rehearsing the 4th and 5th movement of Mahler Symphony no. 7 for the two concerts that take place on the following two days. We were so amazed how the piece already sounded really, really excellent even they were playing it through for the first time. Yes: it is a professional orchestra so we do not expect the conductor saying 'watch my baton' or 'violins - the first note in bar 276 is a F sharp not F natural' that sort of thing, but given that in the 5th movement there are two main tempos and lots of other changes like accelerando (speeding up) and ritardando (slowing down), we were amazed how the orchestra could anticipate what the tempo is (i.e. how do they guess when the second beat will come after the first beat if the conductor didn't even wave his baton before they start playing to signal how quick 1-2-3-4 goes). The conductor also liked giving the musicians some background to explain the piece and therefore how the phrases should be played for evoking a particular feeling. 

The musicians themselves also worked very hard, not only practising beforehand (there were some really difficult fast runs) but also according to Wolfi, he had to listen carefully to the other parts while playing to get the overall picture, or the horn player would walk over to the clarinet player to find out what each other were doing to get an idea of how the phrase carried over. 

In all, if we were not told that it was the first time the orchestra played through the piece (the last time they played it was 2016) we would not be able to tell the difference between a rehearsal and a performance. It was really a treat for us and we were already excited about seeing the actual performance tomorrow.

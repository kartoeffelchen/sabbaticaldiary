Apart from attending the rehearsal yesterday and the performance today, We had some time to walk around the old town in Bamberg for some sightseeing (see the post for 19/12), look at the Christmas market and the shops, ate some nice food, and spent some time chatting to Wolfi and his partner, Daniela (they both play in the Bamberger Symphoniker). 

Of course, the highlight of the trip was the concert itself! Thanks to Martin's influence, I am also starting to know and enjoy Mahler's symphonies better. We had seats very close to the stage so I could watch the conductor giving his gestures to remind the soloists or groups of instrumentalists the articulation he wanted, while Martin followed the symphony using the score that he brought along. The orchestra played so well; it was definitely one of the best concerts we had been to and also our last concert for a little while.

We had a relaxing and memorable break in Bamberg and will definitely come back again in future!

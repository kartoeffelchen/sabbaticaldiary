Like previous years, we had to do lots of Plätzchen-making before Christmas though the variety and quantity we prepared were nothing like what Martin’s German grandmother would have made.

This year we made the following Plätzchen: (in the above photo from left to right) Lebkuchen in chocolate coating (technically Nürnberger style which is made with a mixture of ground nuts and fruit peels; there are other styles such as Bamberger Lebkuchen which are different to Nürnberger Lebkuchen), Spitzbuben (similar to jam biscuits), gingerbread man (not a classic German Plätzchen), Lebkuchen in icing sugar coating and Zimtsterne (biscuits made from ground almond, icing sugar and egg white with a strong hint of cinnamon flavour). However, there is one classic that is well-known both inside and outside Germany, but only eaten occasionally at Martin's home, and that is Stollen - as his grandmother never made them.

We celebrated Christmas on Christmas eve (like other countries in Continental Europe). And with a Christmas tree with real candles and traditional star-decorations made from straw (and a few other things like baubles). 

These are the questions I get asked a lot when it comes to Christmas tree with real candles.

Q: How can you put candles on a tree?
A: With special candle holders like this - you clip it onto a strong twig or branch.

Q: Will the tree not get set on fire?
A: No, if you are careful. The type of Christmas tree that Martin's father buys is called Nordmann fir. It is chosen because the branches near the top are relatively far apart - so there are places you can clip the candle holders so that the candles are not too close to the branches above. Also, the tree is stored in a cold garage or cellar and we only take it out on Christmas eve, so it is still relatively moist (this also stops the needles of the tree from falling off). 

We wish you all a Merry Christmas (Frohe Weihnachten)!

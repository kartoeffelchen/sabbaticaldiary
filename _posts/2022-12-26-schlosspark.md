Apparently there are around 25,000 castles and state homes (Burgen, Schlösser und Herrenhäuser) - this includes ruins - in Germany. In Essingen alone there are three castles! In one of the castles it has a park that is open to the public. We went for a stroll in this park - of course it is nothing like the Gardens of Versailles!

You can buy a castle if you want - some of these are chepaer than a flat in Munich! Though I cannot imagine how expensive it is to maintain it.

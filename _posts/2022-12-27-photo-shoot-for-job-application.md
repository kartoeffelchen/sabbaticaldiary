In the past if you were to apply for a job in Germany, you would also need to submit a photo (hence the photo studio that we were at for a family photo shoot advertised this service - Bewerbungsbilder). I found it peculiar as there could be unconscious bias in the process of selecting applicants for the interview if photos were also supplied in the job applications. Fortunately, this is no longer a requirement in job applications (although many job applicants still submit their photos nevertheless).

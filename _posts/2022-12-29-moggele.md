We encountered this cat at the end of our walk yesterday. It loved being stroke and purred loudly.

While we were stroking the cat, a man walked past us saying something in Swabian (a local dialect in this part of Germany) which, unfortunately, I cannot follow. Not only there are changes in the vowel sounds compared to standard German, but there are also lots of words that are different. Martin thought the man used the word 'Moggele' to refer to the cat, which means a calf (in standard German, that would be Kalb) or a term of endearment for a small child. After doing some googling I think it can also be used to mean a small animal in general. Or maybe the man thought the cat is fat like a cow? We are not totally sure because his family does not speak Swabian so we cannot verify this.

I am always very delighted when I hear people speak in local dialects or with accents - while speaking in local dialects may seem old-fashioned and unwelcoming to others, and sometimes do make communications more difficult, I do think dialects and accents are part of a person's culture and identity which we should not deny or dismiss. Equally, there should not be hierarchical ranking or preference of one pronouncation than another. Sadly, there is a lot of stereotyping when it comes to accents; quoting directly from a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63494849">BBC article</a> last month: 'Almost half of UK workers have had their accents mocked, criticised or singled out in a social setting, a survey suggests.' Like skin colour, sexuality and religion, we should embrace rather than make fun of the differences.

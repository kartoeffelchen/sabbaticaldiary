New Year's Eve is called Silvester in Germany, as the 31st December is also the feast day of Pope Sylvester I. There are a few German customs on New Year's Eve.

Firstly: it is customary to give pigs made from marzipan, or have it as a little ceramic figure, or in other formats. These are known as Glücksschwein - they are given to wish someone good luck. While doing some googling on the origin of Glücksschwein, I came across this interesting <a href="https://www.leidenmedievalistsblog.nl/articles/lucky-pigs-and-protective-boars-the-medieval-origins-of-the-gluecksschwein">blog</a> post, which explained the association of pigs bringing good luck could be dated back to the Middle Ages.

Secondly: the TV channels will play an English sketch recorded in the 1960s called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n7VI0rC8ZA">'Dinner For One'</a> - to ensure no one misses it, all the TV channels will play it several times from the afternoon into the late evening. On the other hand, this sketch is relatively unknown in England. 'Dinner For One' is watched not only in Germany, but also in some other European countries as a New Year's Eve tradition.

Lastly: you would say to others 'guten Rutsch!' - an expression that is used only before the New Year to wish someone a good start in the coming year. The words themselves mean 'good slide' - I heard two theories on the origin of the expression. One theory is the word 'Rutsch' is mangled from a Hebrew word 'Rosch' from 'Rosch ha-Schana' meaning head or start of a year. Another theory is 'Rutsch' used to also mean the same as the German word 'Reise', meaning travel, and 'guten Rutsch' was spoken in particular in Northern Germany in the 19th century to wish someone a good travel, hence 'guten Rutsch' meaning a good travel into the new year.

On that note, I wish everyone 'Guten Rutsch'!

My output last month was a bit limited as I had two weeks of Christmas holiday. I have been working through the lectures and exercises in Havard's <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/">CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</a> course. I hope to do as much as I can before baby arrives.

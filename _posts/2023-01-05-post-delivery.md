The postmen in Munich (and I have also seen them in other cities in Germany) delivery letters and small parcels by bicycles in all weather conditions.

On a related topic: we have had several parcels sent to us gone missing since we moved to Germany (as a rough estimate: we received about 60% successfully and lost 40%); most of the parcels that were lost were sent from abroad. We were unsure if they were held at customs but we never got any notifications either. We were very annoyed as all of the lost parcels were gifts from friends for us or the baby.

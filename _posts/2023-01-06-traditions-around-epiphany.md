6th January is Epiphany (Three Kings’ Day). It is a public holiday in Bavaria and two other federal states in Germany. One Christian tradition around this time of year is called ‘Sternsinger’ - these are groups of children dressed up as the Three Kings whom go around to homes, sing a few songs and collect donations for charities (in return, the children are given chocolates and sweets). Before they leave, they also use chalk to write on the front door the year and the letters CMB. It may look a little cryptic - the letters stand for ‘Christus mansionem benedicat’ meaning ‘May Christ bless this house’. In this case, this house has a sticker version of door chalking.

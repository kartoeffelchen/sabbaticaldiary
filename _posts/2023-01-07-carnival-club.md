We happened to go past Marienplatz and saw a local carnival club (yes - one of the many Verein you get in Germany) hosting an event there. Today they had their coronations of the princes and princesses of Munich for the carnival season. Technically the carnival season starts on 11th November and runs till the start of Lent (Ash Wednesday) though the most active week are the few days before Ash Wednesday (which is 22nd February this year). 

We didn't meet the princes and princesses (and we had no ideas what their roles were) but we saw a band performing Schlager music and also saw several performers dressed up in carnival costumes.

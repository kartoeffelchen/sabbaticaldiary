In Germany, jam doughnuts are eaten during the carnival season, because traditionally Lent was a period of fasting, meaning meat, milk products and eggs were not eaten. These items had to be used up before the start of Lent. This is the same origin as Pancake Day in the UK. 

In most part of Germany, jam doughnuts are called Berliner. In Berlin, they are called Pfannkuchen (which confusingly, Pfannkuchen means pancake). Here in Bavaria, they are called Krapfen.

Martin thinks the jam doughnuts in Germany are different from those in the UK - the dough is fluffier. I personally think they taste better because they are made fresh in a bakery. However, there are definitely interesting fillings other than the traditional fillings of apricot jam or rose hip jam.

For example, we tried a Germkn√∂del jam doughnut, which has poppy seed and icing sugar on top, and spiced plum jam and vanilla pudding inside. We also tried a Blackforest cake jam doughnut, which has chocolate on top, and cherry and cream inside.

The three gates in Munich are part of the fortification that dates back to the Middle Ages. This is one of the three: Karlstor - named after Charles (Karl) Theodore, who was the Elector of Bavaria in the late 18th century. The fortification was dismantled by him to expand the city and he also created the Englisher Garten. I go past here a lot because my gynaecologist is just around the corner from here.

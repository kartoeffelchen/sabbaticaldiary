The January so far has been very mild and the Japanese cherry trees are in full blossoms.

Writing retrospectively, my contractions had already started when I took this photo that morning, but I continued to go pottering around and food shopping without thinking I should be heading to the hospital instead (ignorance is a bliss - I thought I was having a bad back pain from poor posture). We only went to the hospital in the afternoon and spent just over 4 hours in the delivery room until baby Felix was born.

From today onwards, I will try my best to update my diary weekly / biweekly.

Felix is exactly two weeks old today. The first few days after Felix was born, Martin could only visit us at the hospital for 5 hours each day and he couldn’t get very involved with looking after Felix. Since returning home just over a week ago, we have established a routine where Martin does the day shift and I do the night shift of nappy changing, feeding and putting Felix to bed every three hours. There is not much time to do other things but we manage to squeeze out half an hour here and there to play the cello/piano, go for a short walk, or go food shopping and cook a quick meal. 

Our high points: Felix’s bilirubin level was still rising after the second phototherapy and we were prepared to be called back to the hospital for another round of phototherapy. However, his bilirubin level eventually dropped and as he recovered from newborn jaundice, he also became more active and less lethargic.

Felix also met Uncle Philipp for the first time.

Our low point: the first night at home we dressed him too little (because we were too worried about baby overheating) and his body temperature dropped to 35 <sup>o</sup>C. We only realised the next morning using the digital thermometer which the hospital gave it to us for free. Since Felix had to return to the hospital that morning for a blood test, the nurses and doctor gave us advice on keeping him warm and also contacted us later the day to check if his temperature had returned to normal. I found the staff at the hospital very helpful and they reassure us that we can contact them for any concerns we have any time. The takeaway message is: there is a lot to be learnt on looking after a newborn baby!

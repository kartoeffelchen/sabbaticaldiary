We have been doing some admin such as registering birth and applying for benefits (money from the government for the child, for the mother etc.). In addition, the government will pay for my pension for three years (to compensate for mothers taking time out to look after their kids, therefore not paying into their pension funds). Felix also received his first letter, which was sent from the tax bureau notifying his tax number, even though he will not be paying tax anytime soon! 

Our high points: Felix is surprisingly unfussy when it comes to sleeping in his own bed and is not disturbed by noises around him when he is asleep - I can even run a vacuum cleaner past him without waking him up. 

His paternal grandparents (Opa and Granny) visited us and met Felix for the first time.

Our low point: Felix was very cranky after every feed at some point last week - sometimes because of tummy pain, other times because he wanted more milk, and I was feeling frustrated as I was unable to keep him quiet and get him to sleep in the middle of the night. Luckily Martin was more patient and calm, and was very good at working out what Felix wanted by spotting his cues. The takeaway message is: do not get crossed and remember to be kind to ourselves even when things get difficult.

Part of the post-partum care I receive here involves a midwife coming to ours regularly (initially every day or every other day, now twice a week) to check the health of both the mother and the newborn baby. This is paid for by the health insurance. She weighs the baby in each visit and she also shows us how to bathe the baby. We find it really reassuring to have this contact for the first few weeks (especially as first-time parents).

In addition, we are able to borrow an electric pump for pumping breast milk (as part of a doctor's prescription), and even a baby scale from the pharmacy to weigh Felix (because we are curious to see how much milk he gets through breast-feeding)! He drinks a surprisingly large volume of milk (1/30 <sup>th</sup> of his body weight each time, 8-9 times per day - that's the equivalent of me drinking 2-3 litres of milk each meal).

And in a few weeks' time, I will be taking an exercise class for women after giving birth to tone and strengthen the muscles of the back, abodomen and pelvis (this is also covered by the health insurance).

Our high point: 
baby started to show a hint of smile (albeit randomly) this week. 

Our low point: 
Martin had to take Felix to the paediatrician for a routine examination but due to the covid policy at the medical practice, only one parent is allowed inside the medical practice at any time so it was a very stressful experience as he had to do everything on his own (dress and feed an agitated baby while being kicked out of the medical practice, fold and unfold the pram in order to take it up and down a few steps).

Felix turned one month old a few days ago, but as Martin was away for two nights to attend a job interview, we celebrated after he had returned home. Granny kindly came and gave us company during the day while Martin was away. It was delightful to see both granny and Felix enjoyed spending time with each other.

Our high point: 
we had an Indian takeaway and a homemade carrot cake to celebrate the occasion. 

Our low point: 
Felix’s application for his British birth certificate was rejected because we both have British citizenship by descent (I knew about Martin’s status but wasn’t aware of mine). We will need to make an application for his British citizenship, which costs around £1000.

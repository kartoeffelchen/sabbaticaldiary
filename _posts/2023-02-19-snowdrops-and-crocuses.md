Snowdrops and soon after, crocuses, started to appear at the start of this month and as the days are getting longer, we know that spring is arriving! The winter so far is very mild (apart from the first two weeks in December and last two weeks in January) and Bavaria was apparently the sunniest region in the whole Germany in the last two months.

The carnival season reaches its peak activities between last Thursday and today (day before Ash Wednesday, the start of Lent). I would have loved to watch some parades, but it is difficult to go out with a one-month old (also, while Covid is still circulating, I am not keen on taking public transport and go to crowded places with Felix unless it is absolutely necessary). For me, it is already sufficient to eat Berliner/Krapfen (we had a lot in the past few weeks) and look at carnival costumes in the department store.

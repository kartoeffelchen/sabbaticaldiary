The department responsible for children and youths in Munich (Stadtjugendamt München) has been sending us a series of leaflets called ‘Elternbriefe’, parents letters, which contain age-specific information for parents. For example the first letter on one-month old not only contains information on looking after the baby such as breast-feeding, bottle-feeding and sleeping, but also on state benefits for parents and child. There are altogether 43 letters spanning across the first 14 years of a child’s life, initially one letter for each month up till the age of one, then one letter every three months up till the age of 6 and gradually two or one letters per year up till the age of 14. Topics addressed by these letters include: at two years and 9 months old - adoption, at 7 years old and again at 14 years old - consumerism, at 8 years old - stealing, at 8 years and 6 months old - travelling alone on public transport (German kids go to primary schools on their own so the information is useful at this age), at 14 years old - discussions on homosexuality. At the end of each letter is a list of useful telephone numbers if one needs further information or help. Stadtjugendamt München has been sending these letters to parents for free for more than 40 years. We find them really useful for getting parenting tips or information.   

Our high point: Felix’s day/night pattern has started to emerge: he is more alert and active, sleeps less during the day, but he sleeps solidly during the night so although we still need to get up every three hours to feed him, we are also getting better sleeps. 

Our low point: there are generally no complaints - if we have to think of something, then it will be Felix’s crankiness which occurs in some evenings. Fortunately, although there are some screams and cries, we know he will eventually settle down (we just don’t know how long the crankiness lasts).

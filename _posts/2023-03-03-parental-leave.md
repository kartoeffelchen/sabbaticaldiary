Martin is already halfway through his three-months long paternity leave. I can’t complain as most fathers would have less paternity leave than what Martin has. In Germany, parental leave and parental pay are separate: with parental leave, you are legally allowed to be away from work, unpaid, until after the child’s third birthday; with parental pay, as long as you satisfy certain requirements, you can receive money from the government (part of it is non means-tested and part of it is a percentage of your income) for one to two years (depending on whether you want to get it as full-time or part-time income as a subsidy to the lack of income from work). Basically: job guaranteed for three years; money for one to two years. The provision is comparable to the U.K. except one is on paid leave for one year. Whether it is in Germany, U.K. or other western European countries, the statutory parental leave is very generous; compared to my friends in Hong Kong, the statutory paternal and maternal leave are five days and 14 weeks respectively. And I find it astonishing there is no statutory parental leave in the U.S..

Our high point: 
Felix got his first passport this week! The process is surprisingly easy: fill in a form, attend an appointment at a local council office, pay €13 and pick it up immediately. Unfortunately it is only valid for a year because it has less security features than a normal passport, but to renew, we just need to go back to the same place and pay €6. 

Our low point: 
Like last week, Felix gets irritable in some evenings.

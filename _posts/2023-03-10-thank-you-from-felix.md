We want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has sent us their well-wishes, lent us their baby items and given us lots of presents that we are now fully equipped with everything we need for the next year. It is Felix’s fortune to have so many people who adore him and we cannot wait to introduce him to you in person. A special thanks to those who have given us or shared with us items that they as parents have found useful to have or that are the favourites of their children. That’s one advantage of having a child late: we can ask others on their experience of raising their children and learn from them. 

Our high point: 
Felix met his cousin Maxe and his aunt Nick for the first time. 

Our low point: 
one friend told us looking after a newborn baby is not difficult but relentless; it is easy to lose patience and get frustrated when you are tired. I am so grateful that Martin and I can share the responsibility of looking after Felix because if one of us needs a break, the other person can take over. I cannot imagine how single parent looks after a newborn baby 24/7.

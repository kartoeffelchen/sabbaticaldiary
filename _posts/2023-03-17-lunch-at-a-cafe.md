Our quality of sleep has improved in the last week as Felix is able to sleep a little bit longer between each feeds at night, so we can reduce the number of times we have to get up at night from 3-4 times to 2-3 times. As a result, we are able to start doing work-related activities when Felix is having a nap or quiet time, even though we are still on leave. I find I need to continue with the online course that I have been doing to give me something else to think about other than breast-feeding and changing nappies.

Our high point: 
Going to a cafe for lunch! The menu changes every day and a main with a side or drink is only â‚¬8.90. Most importantly, it is quiet and the food is served quickly. We will make it our new weekly activity.

Our low point: 
Felix had his first vaccination. Fortunately, he had a slight fever for only a day afterwards.

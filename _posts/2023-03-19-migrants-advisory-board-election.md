As I do not hold a German passport, I cannot vote in German elections, except as a foreigner I am allowed to vote to choose the representatives for the migrants advisory board (Migrationsbeirat) in Munich. There is one election every 6 years and today is the election day. 

I have to say a few things about the migration advisory board and this election:
* I don't know there is a migrants advisory board until I received the letter about the election.
* The migrants advisory board is an official committee that represents the foreigners living in Munich. They can pass on suggestions or recommendations to the city hall and are involved in projects and events. The aim is to ensure there are equal opportunities for foreigners living in Munich.
* There are 40 representatives who sit on this board, therefore I am allowed to cast 40 votes. Hence the size of the ballot paper - it's huge!
* The electoral service does not supply any information on their website or on paper the groups or organisations to which the candidates belong to, apart from the names, occupations and nationalities of each candidate are printed on the ballot paper. As there are no introductions or manifestos from each group, you don't know their goals unless you look them up on the internet. Bear in mind there are 10+ groups in this election; some have facebook pages or even their dedicated websites, others have no information on the internet.
* Apparently in the last election, the turn out rate was 4%! It is not surprising if the migrants advisory board has such a low profile. 
* Language is also a barrier - the official letter inviting you to vote (see the photo below) is in German. There is a printed leaflet explaining what this election is in English and how you can get the same information in other languages. However, the German proficiency (or English) of a foreigner might not be sufficiently good enough to understand the letter and the leaflet.

I didn't go to vote in person but I signed up a postal vote to ensure the turn out rate for this year's election is greater than 0%!

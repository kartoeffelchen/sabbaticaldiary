It's important to find fun things to do or have a change of scene. For us, this usually means going for a walk every day in the Englisher Garten or Schwabinger See (wheather permitting). As the weather becomes warmer, we may even try to go to a beer garden more often (there are so many beer gardens around). In addition, we enjoy having at least one visitor every week. Last week Philipp came for dinner and we even managed to play a game afterwards! 

Our high point:
Felix started practising his vowel chords and made some 'aah' or 'ooh' sounds when he was content. Finally, he made noises other than screaming and crying.

Our low point: 
Felix kept us awake in between feeds at night for several nights in a row - he was so active and did not want to go back to sleep. We had to take turns so one of us could sleep while the other person would keep the baby quiet. Sometimes we had to relocate one parent with baby to the living room and sleep separately; this is only possible because I got given a Moses basket from Myriam and Felix happily sleeps in it, so we are able to let him sleep safely anywhere we want during the day or night.

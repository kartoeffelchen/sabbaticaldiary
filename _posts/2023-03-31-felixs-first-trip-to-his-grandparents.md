Last weekend we went to Martin's parents and spent a few nights at their home. It was Felix's first trip and he managed very well with both travelling in a car and sleeping in an unfamiliar place. It happened that all of Martin's siblings were also there for the weekend so Felix could spend some time with his aunt, uncles and cousin as well.

It was also the first time we had to rely on the baby sling to carry Felix around when we went for walks as we did not take his pram - it meant that we could go on a slide together!

Our high point: 
Felix met uncle Ben and uncle Bassti for the first time. It was also rather nice to have his grandparents holding him and giving us a break.

Our low point: 
Breastfeeding is hard work, especially when the baby demands a feed every two hours and each feed lasts for 40 minutes - sometimes the breasts are sore and you really just want to give the baby to someone else with a bottle of formula milk so you can have a rest.

I went swimming for the first time since January. Apart from feeling lighter and therefore easier to swim compared to when I was 36 weeks pregnant, the water temperature in the swimming pool feels warmer! I used to find the water temperature quite cool that I wore a long sleeve thermal top for surfers or kayakers when I swam. As I can no longer find information about the closing of saunas and reducing the temperature of the swimming pool by 1 <sup>o</sup>C to 26 <sup>o</sup>C as energy-saving measures from the swimming pool website anymore, I assume they have indeed raised the water temperature back to 27 or even 28<sup>o</sup>C, which is a very pleasant temperature for swimming.

Apart from the benefits of taking cardiovascular exercises, I also enjoy having a break from looking after the baby when I go swimming. The bus to the swimming pool takes me past this art sculpture in Effnerplatz, which apparently costed a whopping amount of â‚¬ 1.5 millions to build! The sculpture is pretty tall and large enough that trams can drive through it.

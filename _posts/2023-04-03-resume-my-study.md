Although my official maternity leave ends next January, I have resumed working through CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course, which I started taking since last December. I am currently using what I have learnt in the lectures to write my own program for logging when Felix feeds. In addition to self-study, I have also returned to swimming after a three-month break. However, I have to sacrifice regular cello practice. I will have to see how I can manage both looking after Felix and studying programming in the next few months.

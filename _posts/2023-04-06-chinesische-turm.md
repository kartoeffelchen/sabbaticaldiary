The beer gardens in Munich re-opened from around mid-March when the weather became warmer. They open daily as long as the weather permits - one beer garden's website describes it is open "bei Biergartenwetter" (during beer garden weather). I think beer garden weather means dry weather.

Today we went to two beer gardens inside the Englisher Garten: we first went to the one next to the lake to get some food. We decided we were still hungry and we walked further south to the one right next to the Chinesische Turm (Chinese Tower) to get more food. I particularly love visiting the beer garden in the Chinesische Turm. The last time we were here, there was a brass band playing folk music. And I remember going to the Christmas market there in my very first visit to Munich a few years ago.

P.S. do you notice someone with a surfboard eating/drinking in the beer garden in the photo?

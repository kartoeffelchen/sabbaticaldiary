Although my official maternity leave ends next January, I have resumed working through CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course, which I started taking since last December. I am currently using what I have learnt in the lectures to write my own program for logging when Felix feeds. I will have to see how I can manage both looking after Felix and studying programming in the next few months.

Our high point:
Felix has been making more "ah-goo" sounds. He also spends more hours awake during the day, during which he is seemingly content and is able to keep himself occupied by kicking his legs, swinging his arms, making sounds and starring at the wooden figures that are hanging on a frame above him. This is a massive improvement from two weeks ago when during the time he was awake, he demanded to be held all the time.

Our low point:
I had a dry throat and runny nose for a few days and I knew perfectly well that the best remedy, which unfortunately I could not get, is a good sleep. Fortunately it was not covid or flu and Felix was not affected by it, apart from having to put up with a slightly grumpy mother for a night or two.

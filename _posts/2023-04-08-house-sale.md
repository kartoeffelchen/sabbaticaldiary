This house that is not far from where we live is currently on sale. On the estate agent’s website it states that it has a ground area of 480 m<sup>2</sup> and the current house, which was built in 1955, has an area of 133 m<sup>2</sup>. So how much do you think it costs, given its close proximity to the Englisher Garten and the city centre?

The answer: €3.54 million. 

When we looked closely at the estate agent website, it suggested the buyer could demonlish the old house and build a new one. Coming from the U.K. this would seem astonishing but this idea of building your own house is more common here, but you will need to have lots of time and energy to deal with the contractors, as well as money obviously. The comment from this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/7mfpgj/building_a_home_in_germany_price/">reddit</a> gives you a favour of what you will need to consider if you want to build your own house.

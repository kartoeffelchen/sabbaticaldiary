Frohe Ostern! Happy Easter! Apart from Easter eggs, these festive foods are also popular in Germany: lamb cake (sponge cake in the shape of a lamb - you need a special baking tin if you want to make this at home) and Easter loaf (a sweet bread made from flour, sugar, butter, eggs and yeast). We will have to give hot cross buns a miss this year!

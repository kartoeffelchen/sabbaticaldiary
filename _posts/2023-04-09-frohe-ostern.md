Frohe Ostern! Happy Easter! 

We have not got much Easter / spring-theme decorations (even though they are popular in Germany) but we have some festive foods instead. Apart from chocolate eggs or coloured hard-boiled eggs, these festive foods are also common: lamb cake (sponge cake in the shape of a lamb - you need a special baking tin if you want to make this at home) and Easter loaf (a sweet bread made from flour, sugar, butter, eggs and yeast).

We have been very lucky to be given a brand new baby carrier (thanks to Anne) that allows us to take Felix on walks where we cannot take the pram with us. This means soon we can start going hiking with Felix in the Alps.

Our high point:
Felix has continued to entertain us by the range of sounds he makes when he is content. And he snores! It is a bliss to watch a baby sleeps peacefully. 

Our low point:
I had a painful right forearm which probably was due to carrying Felix too much without the correct support or from poor posture. I had to rest my arm, but it got better after a few days.

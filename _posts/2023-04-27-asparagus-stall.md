I walked past a different farmers' market today and saw two stands selling asparagus. The asparagus were bundled up together and it costed about â‚¬10-14 per kilo, depending on their sizes. The seller even used ice cubes to keep the asparagus cool.

I decided that although I prefer green asparagus to white asparagus, I should at least buy them and cook them once while living in Germany. I followed this <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/cook-spargel-the-easy-method-1447388">recipe</a> but skipped the Hollandaise sauce. To my surprise, white asparagus are actually quite nice! (It's the Hollandaise sauce that I don't like.) 

Let's get into the craze for asparagus - there is an official asparagus season in Germany and it runs from mid-April to 24th June.

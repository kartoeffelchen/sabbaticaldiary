A few days ago we took the train with Felix for the first time to check the logistics of travelling with a baby, as we will be taking trains when we go to Cambridge in May. I like that we can reserve a seat for Felix without paying for an extra ticket and on ICE trains, there is a designated family area for families traveling with young children - basically there are more seats with tables and spaces to store luggage and prams. On some trains there are separate areas for families with babies and toddlers to offer a quieter space for breastfeeding and for the toddlers to play. And the family area is immediately next to the restaurant car. On some services there are even trained staff to provide entertainment for the children on the train. As for Felix apart from breastfeeding and nappy changing, he slept through most of the journey so I hope it is not going to be too difficult to make the longer journey in May. 

Our high point:
It has been a good week: Felix feeding and sleeping are regular now and we can guess what he demands when he cries: feeding? Or struggling to fall asleep for a nap? He has been making lots of noises (both when he is content and when he needs something) and is a real delight to have him around...

Our low point:
...but he also likes lots of attention and is making it difficult for Martin to concentrate on what he is doing when he is working at home. It is a difficult balance to strike we both want to spend time with Felix, but also have time to do some activities or tasks that do not need to involve Felix (i.e. work or study - we do need to earn money afterall), and keep ourselves healthy (exercises, cook and eat well, and most importantly, sleep). 

The 'low point' entries in all my diary are not moans or complaints, rather, they are mere reflections on how to make things better, for example I need to be better at prioritising and exercise more self-disciplined, such as use the time when Felix is asleep to do my study instead of procrastination.

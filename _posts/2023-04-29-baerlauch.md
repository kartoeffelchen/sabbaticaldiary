Apart from white asparagus, another seasonal ingredients you can find on sale in market stalls and supermarkets are Bärlauch, or wild garlic. We come across these wild garlic plants inside the Englischer Garten. The leaves of wild garlic can be used to make sauces to eat with asparagus or fish, but one must be very careful when picking these and not to be confused with other plants that look very similar but are toxic.

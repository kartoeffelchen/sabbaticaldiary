Maibaum, Maypole, a very long trunk (over 30 m) cut from a fir tree that is painted in the Bavarian colours of white and light blue, with decorations at the top (a wreath and emblems depicting local crafts and industry), can be seen all over many village squares in Bavaria. Maypoles are raised before the festivals that take place on 1/5. There are traditions of stealing and defending the maypoles (because it is an embarrassment if the maypole is stolen). And there are <a href="https://www.br.de/themen/bayern/inhalt/kult-und-brauch/maibaum-diebe-waechter100.html">strict rules</a> on what is allowed and forbidden when stealing a maypole, for example you are not allowed to go into the forest to cut the tree that is designated to be turned into the maypole, you are not allowed to saw the pole into chunks, and one that is already raised cannot be removed. The bounty: beer and Brotzeit (bread, ham, sausage, cheese). Maypoles are replaced every few years. This one in the Viktualienmarkt in central Munich is from 2022.

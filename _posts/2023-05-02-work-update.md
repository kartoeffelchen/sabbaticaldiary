Since my last work update in January I have learnt how to use Django to write dynamic websites and have used it to complete three projects. Two of these are assignments from the online course I am taking; these are not toy problems but making real applications, for example making a wikipedia-like website where you can add or edit articles, and an auction website where you can list an item and place a bid. I also made my own program for recording when I feed Felix and change his nappy.

My plans for this month: 
- start learning discrete maths for computer science;
- continue with the course on web programming using Python and JavaScript that I have been doing

Martin has a call in one evening every week - itâ€™s the perfect opportunity to get out with the baby to go for a stroll after dinner, especially when the weather is good. Also, the cover of the pram can be lowered at this time of the day (so the baby can look at the sky and trees) and you can hear more birds chirping too.

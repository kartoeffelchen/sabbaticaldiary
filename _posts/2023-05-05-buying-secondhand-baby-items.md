I love getting second-hand baby items for Felix from a website called Kleinanzeigen (it's the equivalent of gumtree), because it is cheaper and also better for the environment, especially since babies outgrow their clothes within a few months. Today I travelled to the student accommodations at the Olympic Park to pick up an item and spent a while chatting to the seller. She has even given us a few extra items. 

Our high point:
It has been another good week. Felix (and generally all babies as I found out in this <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_parents_sing_to_babies">article</a>) gets calmer when we sing to him and he makes vocal sounds to imitate us. He is experimenting with making different, sometimes rather amusing sounds at the moment. 

Our low point: 
During the night Felix falls asleep quickly after each feed but during the day he needs to be held and rocked to have a snooze. I don’t understand why he finds having a nap more difficult - perhaps it’s harder to switch off during the day as he wants to look at all the things around him or play. But, at least he sleeps very well at night at the moment, and I am feeling well-rested even though I still need to get up every three to four hours to feed him.

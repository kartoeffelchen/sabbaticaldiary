DM in Germany is the equivalent of Boots in the U.K. (or Watsons in Hong Kong). We buy almost all the healthcare products from the DM store near where we live. And some of the DM stores even have a play area for young kids, a breastfeeding corner and a nappy changing station where they have a free supply of their own brand nappies - it’s really useful for those emergency situations when the baby needs a nappy change while you are out but you don’t have any nappies with you. Obviously it’s also a good way to promote their products and also make you want to shop there. 

Our high point: Felix’s new trick this week is to grab things for with both hands in a much more coordinated manner. 

Our low point: we managed to leave the nappy changing bag at home when we took the train to visit Martin’s parents. Also in the bag was Felix’s milk bottles. Fortunately, we could ask someone sitting in the same train compartment as us to give us a spare nappy. As for milk bottles, somehow Felix no longer needs the extra top-up of formula milk like before so it was not too critical that we didn’t have them either. I am sure all parents will have forgotten to bring spare nappies when they are on an outing with their babies at least once.

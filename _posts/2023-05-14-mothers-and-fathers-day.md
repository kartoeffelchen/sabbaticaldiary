During this week we would have our first Mother’s and Father’s Day. Germany has adopted the U.S. tradition of celebrating Mother’s Day on the second Sunday in May, which is on 14/5 this year (whereas in the U.K. there is no celebration on this day; instead there is Mothering Sunday on the fourth Sunday in Lent - see <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/motheringsunday_1.shtml">here</a> for an explanation). As for Father’s Day, while the U.K. has adopted the same date as in the U.S. (third Sunday in June), in Germany, it is celebrated on Ascension Day (the Thursday 40 days after Easter), which is on 18/5 this year. As we didn’t celebrate the occasion, we had no photo for the day; instead here is a photo that I took after we arrived Cambridge that also fits today’s theme.

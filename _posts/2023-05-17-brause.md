Martin saw this in a supermarket and said I had to try this. Brause is the same kind of thing as sherbet - when you add this to water it fizzes. The unusual thing about this product is the 'Waldmeister' flavour, which is something you don't get in the U.K.. Waldmeister is sweet woodruff in English or Galium odoratum in Latin, a plant that is known for its sweet smell. It is used to flavour sweets and drinks. I think I need to try it a few more times to fully appreciate the flavour. As for Martin, the drink reminds him of his school-days in Germany.

Martin’s friend from secondary school, Tini, sings in a gospel choir and they happened to have a tour stop in Starnberg, which is located just outside Munich. We made a day trip to Starnberg to meet up with her and also went to the concert briefly. It’s our first trip to Starnberg - a town on the edge of a large lake just north of the alps. No wonder it is popular for those who work in Munich but also want to escape from the city.

We set off for Felix’s first trip to Cambridge. We took ICE trains from Munich to Brussels (with only one change in Frankfurt) and stayed overnight in Brussels, before taking the Eurostar to London the next day. Felix enjoyed lying across the seats and even did some tummy exercises. When he was fussy and needed a nap, we could put him in a carrier and walked around a little bit. 

This week’s high point: babies cry - however, we can now distinguish different types of cry to work out what Felix wants, so it’s a high point for us. I also think it is remarkable that a four-month-old can already express his wishes: “I am tired but I can’t fall asleep”, “I haven’t finished my meal and I DO NOT want to have my nappy changed now”, “help!!! I am stuck” (context: Mami put me on my tummy but I cannot roll), “is there anyone around? IS THERE ANYONE AROUND???” etc.. 

This week’s low point: not sure if Felix is having the four-months-old sleep regression or is starting teething soon, as he has not been able to go to sleep immediately after each feed at night, so one of us had to stay up for anything between 15 minutes up to an hour to hold him until he had fallen asleep properly.

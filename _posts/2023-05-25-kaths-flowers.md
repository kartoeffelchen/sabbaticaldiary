My mother who moved to Trumpington only four years ago have made more friends in Trumpington than I do. One of our friends, Kath, used to work in my school as the head of Chemistry, but she retired before I joined the school. She lives on her own but my mother goes for a walk with her regularly. Today, we met up to walk around Trumpington Meadows together and she showed me her beautiful irises and peonies in her allotment.

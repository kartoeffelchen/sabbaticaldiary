It has been a very busy week for us. We have been out almost everyday to take Felix to meet our relatives, friends and my colleagues. It is lovely to catch up with everyone and we enjoy being back in our home and seeing familiar sights (including the cows in the common). In addition, we also visited two nurseries that we have already registered for - we are lucky that we have a lot of flexibility in childcare, nevertheless, to get Felix a nursery place in Cambridge (we are talking about starting as early as September 2024, i.e. in a year and four months’ time), we do need to plan ahead (with some nurseries we are already on their September 2025 waiting list!!!)

This week’s high point: Felix has learnt two tricks. The first one is to suck his thumb (previously he only knows how to suck his whole fist). The second one is to twist his whole body as he tries to roll onto his tummy.

This week’s low point: Felix definitely needs to start some sleep training so that he learns how to fall asleep on his own; throughout the day he goes through this cycle of getting really fussy and cries on top of his voice as he struggles to fall asleep and we have to force the dummy into this mouth and hold him until he is asleep. Even after he is asleep, if we put him on his bed, he gets woken up easily and gets grumpy...

A blue tit fledging by chance came into our living room and Klaudia, our lodger, managed to get it out into the garden. The other baby in the house by chance rolled from his tummy onto his back once this week, but we did not manage to get him to replicate it. 

This week’s high point: Felix met his 契媽 (kai maa) for the first time. The best English translation for 契媽 is ‘godmother’ but Felix’s godmother and Felix are not associated because of religion, but because Felix’s godmother and I are very good friends and we each have a child that is not too far apart in age that we hope as they grow up, they can play with each other frequently. 
 
This week’s low point: Although we are not sleep-deprived, I do wish Felix does not wake up as easily at night and can fall asleep quicker during the day when he has his naps. However, I think we have to accept he sleeps better some days and less so in other days.

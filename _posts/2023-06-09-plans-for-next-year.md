Back in February Martin went for a job interview in Cambridge but he was only offered the job two weeks ago. After further discussions, we are now able to make plans: we will be moving back after Christmas so that Martin can start his new job at the university in January 2024; together with the help of my mum, Felix's 婆婆 (po po - maternal grandmother), we will look after Felix until he has a place at the nursery hopefully in September 2024. It will be very nice for Felix to spend more time with 婆婆 next year.

Our high point this week: it’s Felix’s blessing to have such wonderful grandparents! We left him with 婆婆 (po po) to push him in the pram so he could get an afternoon nap while she went for a walk, and I could finally get some quiet time to do my self-study.

Our low point this week: nothing new to report. We have decided that if we are sleeping reasonably well at night and managing Felix’s naps during the day then we should not generate a problem of thinking Felix needs sleep training.

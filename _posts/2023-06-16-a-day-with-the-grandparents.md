As Martin is in London for work for a week, Felix and I spend the whole day at my parents’ home so I can eat with my parents and Felix gets (breast)fed, taken out for walks and given a shower.  

This week’s high point: his routine is emerging and we are definitely getting better at working out when he needs his three naps during the day. This helps preventing him from having meltdowns due to being too tired. 

This week’s low point: it is definitely getting hotter and drier in the summer months in Cambridge. We had a mini heat wave last weekend and it was hot when we went out for walks. I really hope there is no repeating of the heatwave of 39-40 <sup>o</sup>C like last summer.

Felix and I had our first day trip to London earlier this week. We took a bus to go to the train station and took a train to London. There, we met up with a friend to go to the British Library for an exhibition and we had lunch afterwards. Felix fell asleep while sitting on the train; he was very well-behaved and didn’t scream too much in the library or restaurant. Therefore, I could look at the exhibits in peace and catch up with my friend. Doing a day trip like this is easier than I have expected and I shall do it more often. 

This week’s high point: we had been observing Felix’s behaviour when we were eating for a while. He opened his lips and moved his tongue as in he imitated eating - so we tried giving him a bit of purée in a spoon this week. Actually, since one week old, we have been giving him vitamin D in a teaspoon so he has no problem taking purée from a spoon the very first time. (In Germany Felix gets prescription for vitamin D and fluoride, which comes in the form of effervescence tablets. I have always thought it would be more practical to have it in a solution form and give it to the baby using a dropping pipette. However, it means Felix has been practising drinking from a teaspoon for several months already.)

This week’s low point: as Martin was away for work I had to look after Felix which was especially difficult at night when Felix kept waking up every two to three hours and took a while to rock him back to sleep. While I could put up with him screaming I didn’t want him to disturb our lodger or neighbours, so it was challenging dealing with him on my own.

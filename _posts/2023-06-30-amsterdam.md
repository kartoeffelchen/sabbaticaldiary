After staying in Cambridge over five weeks, we set off to return to Munich via Amsterdam as Martin had to speak at a conference there. We made use of the opportunity to do some sight-seeing and walking around the city. We went to a street market and a museum on microorganism (called Micropia), both of which were recommended to us by one of Martin's colleagues who lives in Amsterdam. At Micropia, I am impressed by how they manage to exhibit microorganisms to make it relevant and interesting. Of the 30 species of microorganisms that they have chosen to exhibit, the majority of them have microscopes which you can use to view them and each one of them has short animation films to explain its significance. Lastly, they have conveyed the important message that there are many microorganisms that are incredibly useful (and of course there are also those that are harmful). I feel this is especially important as many people associate microorganisms as pathogenic and forget the important roles they play in ecology. 

This week's high point: nothing new to report.

This week's low point: it is surprisingly difficult to get Felix to sleep in the hotel cot! The last time we stayed in a hotel in May, he happily slept in the cot, but not this time. I suspect as he is older, he knows more and perhaps he senses he is in a new, unfamiliar environment. Or perhaps he found the cot cold because of the air conditioning in the room. We had to make exceptions by allowing him sleeping next to us for a few nights. However, he should go back to his own bed when we are back in Munich!

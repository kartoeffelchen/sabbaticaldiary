I was not very productive in May and June (hence no work update for two months) as I was busy with catching up with lots of people in Cambridge. In the free time I got, I read a little bit on mathematical thinking in computer science (light touch on proofs, recursion and induction) and completed another exercise in the course on web programming using Python and JavaScript (using the source code given to implement a mail app). This month I want to finish watching the last two lectures and last exercise in the course.

To tackle rising energy costs, the German government launched a €9 ticket for three months between June and August last year. This meant for only €9 a month you could use local transport services and regional trains within the whole country for unlimited times. Since this May, a new ticked called the Deutschland Ticket is launched. It is the same as the €9 ticket except it now costs €49 per month and can only be bought on a monthly subscription. 

So far in Munich I use a stripe ticket because I don’t travel enough to make it worthwhile to get a weekly or monthly ticket (a stripe ticket has 10 stripes and you validate the number of stripes needed depending on how many zones you need to travel in; for most of my travels to the swimming pool or doctor, it costs €3.26 one way on a stripe ticket). However, I have now subscribed for a €49 ticket so I can go into the city centre more often with Felix.

I want to visit several museums and walk around the city before we move back to Cambridge next January, so this week we visited the Deutsches Museum and the Deutsches Jagd- und Fischereimuseum (German hunting and fishing museum).
 
The Deutsches Museum on sciences and technologies is one of our favourite museums. We bought an annual ticket back in October thinking we would go back but somehow we never had the time nor energy to go to the museum in the last few months. Now that Felix is older, why not visit one or two sections of the museum each time until we have seen all the 19 sections? Today we walked around the section on space explorations and the highlights included a space lab and lunar rover (see the photo below). We will definitely go back again in two weeks’ times.

As to the German hunting and fishing museum, I went in order to see their exhibits of stuffed animals such as wild boars and deers, as well as Wolpertinger, which are mythical creatures in Bavarian folklore. Wolpertinger are hybrid animals (see the photo below) - there are no fixed wolpertinger but the most common form is a hybrid consists of a rabbit head, deer antlers, birds’ wings, squirrel body and tail.

This week’s high point: Felix has now tried several purée: sweet potato, apple, carrot, pumpkin and banana. His favourite: banana. The first time we gave him one portion of banana, he ate it quickly and demanded for more afterwards! Hopefully he will learn to like his vegetables too.

This week’s low point: the same old sleeping problem …

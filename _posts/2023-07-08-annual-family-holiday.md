This week we are going on our annual family holiday with Martin’s family (his parents, all his siblings, their partners and child) to a village called Daxstein in the parish of Zenting just outside the Bavarian forest. Martin’s parents organised a family holiday every year so everyone in the family can spend a week together to go for outdoor activities during the day, sit down for a meal and play some games in the evening.

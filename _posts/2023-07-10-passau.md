We went to Passau for a day. It is famous for the baroque architecture in the old town, such as the St. Stephen's Cathedral (where this photo is taken from).

In addition, as it lies in the confluence of the rivers Ilz, Inn and Danube, it is also susceptible to flooding. At the town hall and in some buildings, they marked the water level of some of their worse floods, which were over 12 m for a few occasions.

There is an app called Outdooractive which I use to search for walking routes. Through this app, I found out about a Wackelstein, a rocking rock, that is located in Loh not far from Daxstein. So we went to check it out: it is a very giant rock that weighs 50 tonnes but somehow it wedges on another rock in a way that if you push it in the right place, it will wobble. Team Martin and Felix (in the carrier) managed to make it wobbled!

The area around the town Zwiesel in the Bavarian Forest is famous for glass blowing for a few centuries. We visited a Glass Museum in Frauenau where it explains the history of glass making and glass production in the region. My favourite section is on preserving the local history by reconstructing a typical glass blowing factory through exhibiting various equipment for glass making as well as having the extracts of the interviews from those who once worked in the industry. We also went to a glass factory in Zwiesel where we saw live glass blowing in a workshop and bought a large handmade vase for only â‚¬15!

On the last day of the family holiday we went for a walk inside the Nationalpark Bayerischer Wald, which was established in 1970 to preserve the large primitive forest in the area. The forest is very dense with undergrowth and tall trees. It was formed as the Earth became warmer after the last ice age. A while ago I read a news report on how global warming will change the landscape of Germany, namely the conifer trees like pines and firs that are well adapted to cooler climate will not survive as summers become hotter and drier. 

This week’s high point: Felix was happy with sleeping in the travel cot and although he woke up about twice per night, he went back to sleep very quickly. 

This week’s low point: if Felix got too tired and could not fall asleep, he would scream in a high pitch cry, while this was not new, he had gone fussy that he only wanted to be comforted by me not Martin. It meant not only that I had to hold him until he went to sleep, but for Martin he felt being rejected by Felix. We hope this is only temporary - sometimes I wish I know what baby thinks and why he thinks like that.

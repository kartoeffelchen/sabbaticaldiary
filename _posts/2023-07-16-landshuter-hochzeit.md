Every four years, the members of the society “Die Förderer" have an re-enactment of the bridal procession for the wedding between Hedwig Jagiellon, daughter of the King of Poland, and George, the son of the Duke of Bavaria at Landshut in 1475. This historical event is known as the ‘Landshuter Hochzeit’, the Landshut wedding. The re-enactment involved more than 1000 members dressed up in medieval costumes. The men and women who take part in the re-enactment have to keep their hair long, cover their tattoos and not to show or wear anything that were not present in 1475; in the old town centre the traffic signs and traffic lights along the route are also covered up. 

We were lucky enough to come to the Landshuter Hochzeit as it should have taken place in 2021, but it was postponed due to Covid-19 to this year. We also found a fantastic spot for watching the procession. And as part of the tradition, we greeted the procession with ‘hallooooo’ many times. 

Here are some photos and videos of the procession.

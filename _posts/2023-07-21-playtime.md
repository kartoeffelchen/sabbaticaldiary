It is nice being back at home, so Felix can have all the things he needs for playing and exercising, such as the mat for him to lie on and the wooden frame which he uses to help him to roll (babies are surprisingly resourceful). I also find it fascinating to watch how he figures out how to do things like rolling or lifting his arms and legs while lying on his tummy (to prepare for crawling) or using his hand to reach his foot (to prepare for sitting upright on his own) all by himself. I guess it's all natural instinct.

This week's high point: he managed to fall asleep on his own for a morning nap, and also slept through the night from 9 pm to 5 am without waking up for milk! (Please can we have more of that?) There is also more babbling and laughing (which he does by imitating us talking and laughing). Sometimes he laughs so much that he suddenly starts crying, which is quite amusing to watch.

This week's low point: apart from the on-going screaming he sometimes does, it has been a very good week.

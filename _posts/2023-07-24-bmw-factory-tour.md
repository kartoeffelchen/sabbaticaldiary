I finally managed to go on a guided tour of the BMW factory! I didnâ€™t realise BMW actually assembles their 4 series inside Munich, in the factory complex that is 5 km away from where we live. However, even though the city has grown around the site so it is not possible to expand it, as the tour guide explained, the company constantly searches for innovation to make the car assembly lines more efficient in the space available, rather than moving the factory out of Munich. In fact, part of the site is currently being re-built. Though I do wonder how much pressure there is from the local government to keep the factory inside Munich as it employs close to 8000 people. 

Putting that aside, what did I see? I saw the press shop where the steel sheets are pressed into the shapes for making the different parts of the car bodies, lots of robots (where automation is possible) or workers for welding and screwing the parts together and the painting of the car bodies.

Unfortunately, no photos or videos were allowed, but if you search online, there are many video footages to show the assembly of BMW in one of their factories. And even I am not a car enthusiast, I highly recommend going on the guided tour. The BMW museum is also said to be excellent and I will write about it once I have been to the museum.

The public transport network in Germany (especially in big cities) is excellent - here in Munich apart from buses, trams and metro lines, there are also sub-urban train connections with the towns outside Munich. We made use of one of the sub-urban train line to get to one of the lakes south of Munich, from there we walked to the Andechs Abbey, had lunch at the beer garden, and walked back. 

This week's high point: Felix is getting better with eating porridge and taking sips of water from a cup, compared to a few weeks ago. I make his porridge by mixing together milk, millet flakes and a few teaspoons of vegetable or fruit pur√©e and sometimes salmon flakes or peanut butter. Also, he seems to be happy with being held by Martin again, though occassionally he still prefers having me to comfort him.

This week's low point: there is nothing new to report.

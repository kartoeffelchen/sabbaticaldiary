We went for a walk along the River Isar, but instead of staying in our local area, we took the metro to go south to Sendling, and from there we walked along the river until we crossed the Reichenbachbr√ºcke to walk to Marienplatz. This was the first time we walked along this stretch of the river.

One of the places we visited today was the Flaucher. It is a floodplain that is popular amongst the locals to go sun-bathing and swimming in the Isar in the summer.

The other place we visited was the rose garden. Inside the garden were lots of roses, as the name suggested, but for us the hightlight was a small educational garden on toxic plants, because we were not fully aware that some common plants that can be seen in gardens or woodlands are toxic if consumed. (Some examples are listed <a href="https://www.homesandgardens.com/gardens/poisonous-plants">here</a>.)

One note to make: we were really surprised to find out in our guide book that the section of the river we walked along in this walk was only renatured just over a decade ago (between 2000 and 2011) in order to improve the flood defence and offer more outdoor space on the river banks for sports and leisure activities. I found this excellent time-lapsed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAmpgEieg9o">video</a> recorded in 2009 to show how this was done.

We had another outing to a small village called Possenhofen on the edge of the Starnberger See, the largest lake that is within reach from Munich using the S-Bahn (sub-urban trains). From there we walked along the lake to reach Tutzing. Many cyclists cycle on the same path to go around the lake (the whole route is around 50 km long) with many places to stop for a loo break, eat or drink, and to look at the lake, the mountains, the chapels and castles etc. along the route.

This week we had a transport theme outing. We went to the Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum, a branch of the Deutsches Museum that only exhibits transportation(and we only managed to see one of their three halls); the themes on public transport planning and car safety were particularly interesting. We also went on a guided tour of the BMW Museum; apart from seeing lots of cars and motorbikes, it was good to see, albeit small, the company’s acknowledgment of using forced labour to make aircraft engines during the second world war. 

This week’s high point: Felix is a good sleeper and eater. What else do I want?

This week’s low point: nothing new to note.

Other observations (for things that are neither ups nor downs): Felix has started to get clingy if he is left on his own for a few minutes. He is now old enough to realise that he needs us (previously he has no awareness of that and he can be held by anyone) so if he is left alone while I am getting a shower or cooking in the kitchen, he can get upset quickly.

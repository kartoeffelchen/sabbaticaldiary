My github overview has many grey squares in the last three months (for non-programmers, grey squares mean I have not been updating my codes, either because I have not updated this diary nor written any codes). I had a phase that I was fairly productive when Felix was around two to four months old (I started to get better sleep and he still had long naps during the day). Then when he was four months old he slept badly and we were away in Cambridge. After coming back from Cambridge, Felix, being six months old, spent less time sleeping and demanded more of my attention, making it difficult to set aside a chunk of time to learn programming. 

So we have decided to try something new this month: for a few mornings per week I will hand Felix over to Martin so that I can get on with some programming, while Martin can also spend some quality time with Felix. Outside these time, I will squeeze in time when Felix allows me to, for example while he is having a nap or playing happily on his own. I hope this way I can keep doing a bit of programming or otherwise I will forget very quickly.

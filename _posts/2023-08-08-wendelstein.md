After several days of rain and occasionally, thunderstorm, we finally had a day of glorious weather so we decided to go to the mountains! It took just over an hour to get to Osterhofen from Munich, and from there we took a cable car to reach the top of Wendelstein. We walked to the peak (today’s visibility was good enough to see Munich, Zugspitze - the tallest peak in Germany, and many other snow covered peaks in Austria), did a panoramic walk and visited a cave. Let’s hope there will be more days of good weather between now and October to have more day trips to the mountains.

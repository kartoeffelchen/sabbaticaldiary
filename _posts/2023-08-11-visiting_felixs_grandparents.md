We visited Felix's paternal grandparents for a long weekend. We discovered that we could take a regional train to get from Munich to Aalen. Although it took 25 minutes longer, the journey was covered by our Deutschland Ticket, it required no change and the operator for this particular route had new trains, making the journey pretty pleasant.

This week's high point: nothing new to report.

This week's low point: when giving Felix solid food, if he got upset (most of the time for reasons we did not understand), he would refuse to continue to eat. He clearly still prefers being breastfed as it is comforting. I am sure the time will come when he likes eating his food.

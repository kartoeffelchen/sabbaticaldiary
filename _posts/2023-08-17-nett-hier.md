If you happen to see a lamp post that is full of stickers (in this case, on a sign in the metro station close to where we live), look closely and you may spot one of these 'nett hier' stickers.

Around 20 years ago, the Baden-Württemburg state launched a marketing campaign to advertise the state with a slogan 'Wir können alles. Außer Hochdeutsch.' which in English means 'we can do everything, except speaking in standard German'. It is a very witty statement (yes, Germans also have humour) because the Swabian dialect spoken in the area is known to be difficult to understand. The marking agency that came up with this slogan also came up with a slogan 'Nett hier. Aber waren Sie schon mal in Baden-Württemberg?' which in English means 'it's pretty here, but have you been to Baden-Württemberg?' which was used by the German train company, Deutsche Bahn, for a short time around a similar time. 

As part of the marketing campaign, the 'Nett hier...' was made into stickers and given away; people got these stickers and have been sticking them everywhere, including up on the Himalayas and even in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvAAvBGAeWF/">shipwreck</a>! (There is a whole <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nett_hier_/">Instagram account</a> dedicated to these.)

It was quite hot in the last few days, and often there were thunderstorms in the late afternoon (this is not uncommon when it gets hot here), which made going out with Felix difficult. While museums are good if we don't want the mid-day heat, if Felix screams it is unfriendly to other visitors. If we go outdoors then we need to think about places we can go that have lots of shade and we also need toilet facilities. As well as the Englischer Garten, I discovered today the Schloss Park in Schloss Nymphenburg is excellent for walking around. It is a bit far from us but inside the park there are lots of trees and benches.    

This week's high point: Felix has been rolling around more, including doing a roll in order to reach his dummy that was otherwise out of his reach.

This week's low point: nothing new to report.

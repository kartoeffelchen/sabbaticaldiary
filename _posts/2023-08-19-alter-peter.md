We followed our guidebook to do a walking tour around where the old Medival wall in Munich was to learn a bit about the history of Munich in the Middle Ages. For example we stopped at the oldest church in Munich, the church of St. Peter (known locally as Alter Peter, Old Peter), the old residence for the duke that ruled the city and walked along the routes where salt and wine (the two most important products traded at the time) would be brought into the city.

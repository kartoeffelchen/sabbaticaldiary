This weekend is the Zamanand Festival, a festival that takes place twice a year when a section of a normally busy road is completely closed to traffic and is turned into a festival venue with many stages for artists, food vans and activity stalls dotted along the road. The festival promotes cohesion, respect, tolerance and sustainability.

We came here because one of the branches of the German central bank had an open day this weekend (as part of the festival). We went to lift a gold bar and we learnt how to tell apart real and fake bank notes.

Unfortunately, it was very hot today (32 <sub>o</sub>C) and as there was no shade on the road, we did not stay very long in the festival.

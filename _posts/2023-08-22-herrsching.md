We thought it would be a good idea to go for another excursion using public transport, so we went back to Herrsching. We planned to walk from Herrsching to Stegen along the lake and return to Herrsching by taking the boat. Except it was so hot today we only managed to walk a very short distance and sat in a beer garden by the lake instead.

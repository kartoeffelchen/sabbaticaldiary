I always dream of putting one of these signs outside our house to announce the arrival of our baby but Felix came before I had time to make one or order one online. In addition, I don't see them around in Munich (maybe it seems old-fashioned or simply, there is no place to put it). However, you can often see that in the smaller towns and villages in Germany. For those who don't know, it is a <a href="https://www.birdspot.co.uk/culture/storks-and-the-delivery-of-babies">European folklore</a> that storks bring babies to families, hence the sign of a stork with a baby carried in a sling.

This week's high point: Felix is more stable when he sits on his own.

This week's low point: Felix can get really upset if he is left with Martin and he does not see me at home; on the other hand, he does not mind if he is out with Martin on a shopping trip without me.

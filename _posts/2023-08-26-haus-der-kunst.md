We went to Haus der Kunst to look at an art exhibition called 'Reset Now'. This exhibition features installations around the theme of art, technology and science by contemporary women artists. We actually know one of the artists in this exhibition, Sophia Pompéry. This is her piece (explanation in <a href="https://www.kuenstlerverbund-hausderkunst.de/ausstellungen/resetnow/kuenstlerinnen/sophia-pompery.html">German</a> and in <a href="http://www.sophiapompery.de/files/portfoliosophiapompery2022eng.pdf">English, which is on the second page of the PDF file</a>).

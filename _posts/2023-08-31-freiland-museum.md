There is an open air museum outside Schw√§bisch hall (called Hohenloher Freilandmuseum) where they preserve old houses and household items or handcraft tools from the farms and villages in the area to show the lives of people living in the rural areas in the past. They also have some farm animals including the local breed of pigs.

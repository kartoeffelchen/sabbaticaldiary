I have to pass the A1 level in German proficiency test in order to renew my residence permit and as my permit is expiring soon, I have to do the test as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the tests in Munich were fully booked so I had to travel to Schwäbisch Hall to sit the test. Had Brexit not happen, I would be able to stay in Germany without needing a permit in the first place: bloody Brexit! 

The old town centre in Schwäbisch Hall is a pretty town that retains numerous original half-timbered houses and the narrow cobblestone streets from the Middle Ages. It is also a very special place for me as I took a German intensive course here during my Easter holiday in 2017. Therefore, it is nice to come back to walk around the town and to visit the Hohenloher Freilandmuseum in Wackershofen. 

The high point of the week: we had a home visit from a paediatric nurse earlier this week and we used the opportunity to ask her about getting Felix to nap and about his crying. We will have to do some work to train Felix to have a nap in his bed.

The low point of this week: nothing new to report.

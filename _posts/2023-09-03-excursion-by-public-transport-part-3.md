Felix and I went for another walk in Munich - this time we walked along a small stream that flows past the pretty village of Obermenzing that is within the city boundary of Munich but is otherwise, very quiet and peaceful. We walked past a castle called Schloss Blutenburg that stands in front of a large lake, the village church, pub and Maypole, a large field full of sunflowers, gladioli, lilies and dahlia where you can cut your own flowers, and a popular beer garden located next to an old mill.

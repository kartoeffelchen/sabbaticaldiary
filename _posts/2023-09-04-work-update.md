The arrangement of Martin taking over for two to three hours, several days a week, seems to have helped me to get back on track to learn some programming. This is also the amount of time I will need to spend on one module for my Open University course. I have almost finished the last exercise in the CS50 Web Programming course and I am proud of the progress I have made, namely to use Django and JavaScript to write simple apps such as an e-bay like auction website or a Twitter like social network website. This month I will start working through my course material to get a head-start (even though the official start is 7th October).

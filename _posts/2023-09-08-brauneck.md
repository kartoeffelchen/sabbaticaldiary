We had another outing to the mountains. This time we took a train to Lenggries, changed for a bus and took a gondola to Brauneck. At the top we did a circular walk up Brauneck and Latschenkopf and we stopped at a hut for a bite. It was a bit hazy so we could not see the peaks nearby clearly, nevertheless we had a fantastic (at times, challenging) walk which we really enjoyed. 

This week's high point: nothing to note. 

This week's low point: Felix started to have night wakings that were more frequent than before, like every two hours - maybe he is having 8-month sleep regression. It felt like looking after a newborn baby except Felix is much bigger and harder to carry him around. 

Other points to note: we had our first visit by a children’s psychologist to see how we can address Felix’s problems (namely to get better at falling asleep and sleep solidly especially when having a nap at day time and not to be completely upset when he is left with Martin when I am out). I know we have to break a few habits so it will not be easy but we will give a go!

Vincent, my long time friend, came to visit us for a few days. We walked from our flat through the Englisher Garten to the Chinesischen Turm to eat at the beer garden, walked to the Monopteros to take a view of the city, watched the surfers in Eisbach, walked around Marienplatz and ate ice-cream at a shop. Whenever we have visitors, we will do this walk.

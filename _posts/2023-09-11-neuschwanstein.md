We took a day trip to visit Neuschwanstein. From Munich it took just under three hours to get to Hohenschwangau, and from there we walked up the hill, made the obligatory stop at Marienbrücke and reached the entrance of the castle (we didn’t enter it) before taking a hybrid horse and electric powered carriage downhill. It is doable as a day-trip from Munich (but personally I would prefer to stay in the area for a few days so I can walk around the mountains and alpine lakes too). Personal highlights were climbing to the outlook point that was further above the Marienbrücke to enjoy the view without others around and looking at the castle in front of a huge mountain range and meadows from the train window just outside Füssen. I am glad I have finally seen the castle.

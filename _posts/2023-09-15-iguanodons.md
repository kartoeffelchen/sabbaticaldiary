Martin was in Brussels for work for five days and we arrived yesterday to join him. Today we went to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences - what a fantastic museum! They have an excellent gallery of iguanodons fossils (lots and lots of intact fossils that were discovered in a coal mine in Bernissart), as well as many interactive displays to explain the features of other types of dinosaurs. I now learn enough that I can tell Felix about each type of dinosaur that appears in his dinosaur soft book. 
 
This week’s high point: nothing new to note.

This week’s low point: Felix has learnt to protest - if he is unhappy, he will kick, cry with his mouth shut or spit out his dummy if you push it into his mouth.

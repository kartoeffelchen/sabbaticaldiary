Martin caught Covid while in Brussels and subsequently passed it onto me. We had to cancel our trip to Cambridge and to the USA respectively. We were obviously gutted: I wanted to see my parents and Anne again, while Martin wanted to give his talk in a conference. Fortunately, we did not get too unwell with Covid and we did not fall ill at the same time, so one of us could have some rest while the other person could look after Felix.

This week's high point: Felix had started to pull himself forward when lying on the bed. He might be able to crawl properly soon.

This week's low point: nothing to note.

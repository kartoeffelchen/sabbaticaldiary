At the Aumeister beer garden today, they had a liitle ceremony to open a barrel of beer by using a big hammer to hit the tap into the side of the barrel, and they shouted 'O'zapft is' (which is 'es ist angezapft' in Bavarian, meaning 'it is tapped'). It was done in the same way as the official opening of Oktoberfest - in fact, that beer is the same as what you can get in the beer tents during Oktoberfest. There was also a small band playing some Bavarian folk music.

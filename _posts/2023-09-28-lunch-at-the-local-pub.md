Lately as I took Felix out in the pram, he protested within 10 minutes because he was tired but couldnâ€™t fall asleep in his pram. The same thing happened today and I could not go to a cafe as I had planned. Instead, I had to put Felix in the baby carrier and we U-turned. I ended up eating a delicious roast pork in the beer garden of the local pub while Felix slept happily in the baby carrier. And we enjoyed the lovely autumn sunshine together.

We went to a baby sing and sign class for the first time. The idea behind baby signing is that baby can communicate with signs before they are able to talk - so if they are able to communicate better (e.g. I need a drink, I want more food etc.) then they do not have to cry and the parents do not have to guess why they are upset; it is a win-win situation for everyone. We do not know when Felix will grasp the meanings of the signs but if we start practising, maybe he will get it at some point and use it to communicate with us. We shall see.

This week's high point: nothing to note.

This week's low point: Felix also caught Covid and had a high temperature for two days, but he recovered quickly. In addition, we started sleep training Felix because it was getting difficult to get him to sleep: he did not want to sleep on his own, or if he fell asleep and we put him in his cot, he would wake up immediately, and he had been getting up every one to two hours during the night. When he was younger, we thought about whether he needed sleep training, but decided against it. However, his sleep had definitely gone worse and we decided that we had to do something about it. The sleep training method we used involved letting the baby cry without giving the baby any help until the baby falls asleep - it is very mentally very tough as no one wants to see a baby feeling upset. This is why we avoided sleep training as long as we could.

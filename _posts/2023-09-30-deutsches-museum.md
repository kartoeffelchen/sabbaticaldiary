We visited the Deutsches Museum for two consecutive days as our annual ticket will expire after tomorrow. Now that I have seen about 70% of the museum, I can say the best exhibit is the one on modern aircrafts because there are some excellent models and demonstrations to explain how aeroplanes fly and how their designs help them to be more aerodynamic. And you can see things like their engines, a cross-section of the fuselage, the cockpit etc.. As a chemist, I am also very impressed by the sections on chemistry and atomic physics. It is definitely one of our favourite museums.

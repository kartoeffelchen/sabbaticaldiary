This week we had our second visit by the same children’s psychologist to discuss how to fix Felix’s sleep problems. We also continued sleep training Felix which we started last week - and what a difference it has made! We are now able to lay him down on his bed while he is awake and let him fall asleep on his own without him crying or fussing. During the day we are also able to get him to have a nap without carrying him in a carrier or in our arms to get him to fall asleep. He is also now able to sleep in his pram again when we go for a walk. 

This week’s high point: apart from Felix sleeps better, he is also growing his first two teeth (incisors in his lower jaw).

This week’s low point: Felix still wakes up every two to three hours at night. We need to see what we can do to encourage him to sleep for a bit longer. There are various reasons that come into my mind: teething pain (obviously this does not help with sleeping but there is soothing gel if it is too problematic); eating more solid food (to ensure he has enough calories and he stays full for longer at night); more sleep training so he learns to self-sooth (meaning if he wakes up, he can get himself go back to sleep without crying for help).

I love a walk in the park of Schloss Nymphenburg because there are lots of old trees, meadows, canals, lakes and outbuildings dotted around the park - but it is a bit far to get there from where we live. As I had to take Felix to west Munich close to Laim today, we made use of the opportunity to go to the Schlosswirtschaft (a gastropub outside the palace) to have a lovely lunch and to go for a walk in the park.

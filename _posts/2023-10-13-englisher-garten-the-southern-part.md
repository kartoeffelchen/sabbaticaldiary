I went for a walk in the southern part of the Englisher Garten today. The one nice thing about Munich is that you can walk or cycle directly along the river Isar from the south of the city to the north all the way (I suppose Cambridge is unique that some colleges own the land on both sides of the river Cam, therefore there is no public way directly along the river where the colleges are). I also stopped by Friedensengel, the Angel of Peace monument.

This week’s high point: Felix can creep forward! The German word ‘robben’ means a baby slides on the belly like the way a seal does - is a pretty good description of how Felix creeps forward. 

This week’s low point: nothing new.

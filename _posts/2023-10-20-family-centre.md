One mother that we have met in the baby class has suggested that we could meet up at a Familienzentrum (family centre) near where we live. There are several of these around in Munich; these are state-funded organisations where babies or toddlers can go to play for free or for a small amount of money (between €2-5 for each session), while parents can talk to each other, or even midwives or advisors to get help if they have any problems relating to raising their children. We went along earlier the week to a 'breakfast club' where there was breakfast provided (they only asked for a donation of €2). It's really great that such provision exists and that I can meet other parents and babies, and it's very international too! I met Germans, Ukrainians, Americans, Chinese and Vietnamese.  

This week’s high point: Felix’s creeping (I regard it as breast strokes but on a floor) has improved rapidly this week. He is especially motivated to creep forward if he wants to reach my mobile phone or cables. 

This week’s low point: He seems to be getting lots of short naps of 30 minutes, three naps a day, and is still waking up every two to three hours at night. Each time he wakes up, he rolls onto his tummy and takes a while to settle down again.

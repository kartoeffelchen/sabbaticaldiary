The sun shone for a day in between several days of unsettled weather. And it was warm - too warm for October - every one made use of the fine weather to go to Rosenstein, a large limestone outcrop on a hill near Essingen, for an outing, thinking this would be the last chance to enjoy the autumn sun before it gets cold. There were families walking on the hiking trails, children and teenagers climbing around the old castle ruin, climbers climbing on the rock, even riders riding their horses.

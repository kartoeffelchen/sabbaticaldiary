We just spent a week to visit Martin's parents because Martin is currently abroad for work and it is pretty hard work to look after a 9-month-old baby on your own: as Felix is a lot more mobile now, he needs to be watched constantly as he especially likes pulling the cables. This means if I want to disappear briefly to go to the toilet or take a shower, either I have to put him in his bed (which he will protest because he does not like being left alone) or I have to wait until he is asleep (but he wakes up again very quickly to look for his dummy or he decides he has slept enough for his nap), so there is actually not much time for me to do anything. It is also very nice for Felix to spend precious time with his grandparents especially since we currently do not live too far from them - so this is the win-win situation for all of us: I can have a break from Felix, grandparents can read to Felix, play with him or take him out on a walk.

This week's high point: nothing new to add.

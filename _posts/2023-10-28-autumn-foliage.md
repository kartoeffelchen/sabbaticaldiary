By now, all the deciduous trees are yellow, orange and brown in colour. And as the weather was fantastic today, after having breakfast at Gaststätte Großmarkt (I will write more about that in tomorrow's post), we walked along the Isar until we reached the Großhesseloher Brücke, a dual rail and pedestrian bridge that crosses the Isar, and then took a bus and metro to return to central Munich. During the walk we enjoyed bathing in the autumn sun (there were even a few people swimming in the Isar!), listening to the rustling of leaves as the wind blew and kicking around the fallen leaves. Today I had the perfect autumn day.

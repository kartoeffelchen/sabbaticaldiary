I have previously mentioned Weißwurst, white sausage, in a post or two, but I have not talked much about what it is.  

Weißwurst is a Bavarian speciality that is traditionally eaten before midday - it is because the sausage is made with chopped veal, pork and herbs without nitrite as preservative, therefore the colour of the meat turns greyish white during the cooking process. And as it has no preservative, the sausage must be freshly made and eaten on the same day. Nowadays, you can buy them in supermarket with a relatively long shelf-life.

Another peculiar thing about Weißwurst is that you do not eat the skin of the sausage. You are supposed to cut it into half and pull the meat out (or bite the top off and squeeze out the meat). 

Weißwurst is always eaten with sweet mustard (also a Bavarian speciality), Breze (Pretzel) and wheat beer.

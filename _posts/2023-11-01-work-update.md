I have been taking my course at the Open University for a month now. The current module I am studying is an introduction to information and communication technology which is not difficult for me; although I have met a lot of the concepts before, there is something new, something interesting nevertheless, such as a brief introduction to the history of computers. My study usually involves reading through the textbook provided and doing the activities from the textbook or online. Every few weeks, I attend online tutorials. I try to study for around two hours in the morning if Martin can look after Felix or in the evening after Felix has gone to sleep. If the weather is good (like today), I would go for a walk and read on a bench while Felix sleeps in the pram (I took this photo while sitting on a bench in the Englisher Garten).

We had another visit by the healthcare visitor and she was delighted to hear about Felix’s progress and also improvement in his sleep - though after her visit, his sleep got bad again (waking up every two to three hours and refusing to take the dummy to help him to go back to sleep). By this point we really should have accepted that there are good nights and bad nights - just like adults - and we generally have more good nights of sleep. When the weather is good, I sometimes take him out for an afternoon walk and I let him sleep in the pram, while I sit on a bench to do some work. Earlier the week on one of our walks, we saw the shepherd and the flock of sheep in the Englisher Garten again. Several others also stopped and looked at the sheep.

This week’s high point: nothing new to note.

This week’s low point: his sleep improved and then regressed.

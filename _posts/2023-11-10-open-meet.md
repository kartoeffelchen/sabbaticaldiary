We now have a weekly routine that consists of going to an ‘open meet’ session in a children centre once or twice a week where Felix can play and meet other babies, and I can talk to other mothers. However, I generally don’t enjoy having a conversation about babies with other mothers because it usually involves a moan about how hard it is to get a nursery place (it’s just as bad in Munich as in Cambridge), or other things that are not worth talking about (such as got given too much clothes and toys, clothes that outgrow quickly etc.). Worse of all, I know I should not compare Felix with other babies but somehow all the babies that I have met, whom are similar age to Felix (1 month younger or older), have more teeth, are more mobile and can babble with more vowels. But not Felix... In addition, we occasionally go to the library for nursery rhymes and we also have a weekly baby sing and sign class. No doubt Felix is happily occupied. 

The photo was taken earlier the week when Felix was one of the three babies who was at a particular open meet session - he had the whole room and all the toys to himself!

This week’s high point: all of a sudden on the same day he learnt to sit upright without our help and pulled himself standing up. His third teeth has also erupted.

This week’s low point: he kept waking up in the night - but at least we realised retrospectively he probably had teething pain that caused him sleeping lightly.

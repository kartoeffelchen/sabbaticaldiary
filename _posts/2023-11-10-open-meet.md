We now have a weekly routine that consists of going to an ‘open meet’ (stay and play) session in a children centre once or twice a week where Felix can play and meet other babies or toddlers, and I can talk to other mothers. However, I have not found it easy to have a conversation with others (I have always found it difficult to talk to others that I barely know, let alone in German). As well as these 'open meet' sessions that we go to, we also go to the library for nursery rhymes and the weekly baby sing and sign class. No doubt Felix is happily occupied. 

The photo was taken earlier the week when Felix was one of the three babies who was at a particular open meet session - he had the whole room and all the toys to himself!

This week’s high point: all of a sudden on the same day he learnt to sit upright without our help and pulled himself standing up. His third teeth has also erupted.

This week’s low point: he kept waking up in the night - but at least we realised retrospectively he probably had teething pain that caused him sleeping lightly.

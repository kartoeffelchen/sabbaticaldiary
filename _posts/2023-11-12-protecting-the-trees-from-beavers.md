Around the Englisher Garten and in other parks in Munich, you often see trees with a wire cage at the bottom - this is to protect them from beavers chewing the trees. However, not all trees are protected so that beavers have some trees they can chew on for food and building their habitats. In this photo, you can see the tree on the left has been recently nibbled and the tree on the right is protected. I have never seen a beaver though; they are very shy.

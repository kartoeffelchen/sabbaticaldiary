Despite the unsettled weather, I took Felix to ‘open meet’ sessions whenever possible so he could play with other toys and have a chance of scene; he enjoys going out and playing with things he has not seen before - it is fascinating to see how curious a baby (and young child) gets. 

This week’s high point: Felix, who turned 10 months old a few days ago, has been doing more kneeling and reaching high up, for example pulling the things from the coffee table. He is increasingly becoming more successful at pulling himself up on his own.

This week’s low point: feeding Felix can be frustrating sometimes - at the moment, he seems to enjoy eating bread, Zwieback, banana, raspberries, blueberries and kiwi the most. The problem is he likes to feed himself, so I have to cook him food that he can pick it up. I don’t mind cooking for him especailly since often we eat the same as what we give him, but what I can make for him is limited (even though I know there are lots of baby-led weaning recipes out there, I don't always feel inspired by them). However, we have found that if we give him something to hold onto (ideally, food which he can pick it up, otherwise, non-edible item such as a spoon), then we have a higher success of spoon feeding him purée at the same time.

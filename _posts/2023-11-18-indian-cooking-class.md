Yesterday, I took an evening class at an adult education centre to learn about cooking Indian curry. There were about 14 participants and we were divided into groups to prepare one to two dishes, and at the end there were five different dishes (and mango lassi) to try: lentil curry soup, potato curry with peas, paneer cheese with spinach, lentil curry, Indian rice. It was a fun occasion to have a baby-free evening, cook and talk to different people.

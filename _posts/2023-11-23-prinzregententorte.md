This is a cake that I have never seen it in anywhere else apart from in Munich: Prinzregententorte (Prince Regent gâteau). It is a cake made from thin sponge and chocolate cream layers, with a chocolate glaze at the top. One of the sources I read claimed that it was invented by the court baker Rottenhöfer which dedicated the cake to Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria.

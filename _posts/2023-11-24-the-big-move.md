For our move to Cambridge, we hired Nate, who ran a track-and-man company, to transport our belongings for us, as it’s much harder to move it ourselves, given the distance we need to drive. On Monday Nate came and loaded up his van. On Friday Martin met him in Cambridge for the unload. All we have got left that we need to take with us in December are two suitcases of clothes and shoes, a travel cot and a pram. Felix, in the meantime, is easily entertained by anything that he has not played before: a wooden spoon, a plastic bottle, a muslin cloth, a network cable etc. so he will not be bored even though almost all his toys are packed and sent away. 

This week’s high point: Felix is now doing more standing up, but he is also getting more frustrated and throws his temper (e.g. if he can’t pull himself up, or he has eaten all his raspberries but he wants more, or he does not want to be fed by a spoon etc.)

This week’s low point: he still wakes up every few hours and needs to be given milk before falling back to sleep - but given that he has a few teeth growing (middle two incisors at the top and two more incisors at the bottom), I suspect he will continue to get teething pain for a while and therefore, not able to sleep well.

Although it started snowing and it was cold, we still went out today. The snow was not too thick so we could still push the pram. We are lucky that we can borrow some thick clothes from Felix’s cousin so we can dress up Felix with lots of layers to keep him warm. 

This week’s high point: nothing new to note. 

This week’s low point: Felix caught a cold and had a fever earlier the week, so we had a grumpy baby that did not want to eat his favourite banana (!!!) and woke up every hour at night as he had a blocked nose.

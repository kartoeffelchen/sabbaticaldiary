It started snowing on Thursday and two days later (Saturday), it was still snowing. In fact, it snowed so much overnight that this morning, the trams and trains were unable to run, and the pavements and smaller streets were not gritted (this was unexpected - I had thought Germans cope well with snow in winter). Fortunately, the metro was still running so we could go out to the city centre to meet a friend for brunch. On our way, we saw a man entering the train and carrying a brand new toboggan in his arm - he looked so satisfied (maybe he bought one of the last toboggans in the shop - I would not be surprised if they were sold out today). The children took the opportunities to go tobogganing, like on this small slope not far from where we live. Felix is too young to appreciate it, but for me it was an experience walking around the snow that was about 20cm deep. Although it snows in winter in Munich, it is unusual to get such a sheer amount of snow here.

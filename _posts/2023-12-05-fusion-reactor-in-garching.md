In Garching, where Martinâ€™s faculty building is located, there are also a fission reactor and a fusion reactor for running experiments. Back in July, Martin organised for his colleagues to go on the tour of the fission reactor, but I had to miss it as I was breastfeeding. Today, he organised for his colleagues a tour of the Tokamak fusion reactor so I tagged along. We had an hour long introduction on what nuclear fusion is, followed by a tour of the facility - you cannot actually see the reactor itself but you can see where it sits in the building, the control room and the generators for generating electricity needed to run an experiment (the electricity consumption needed to run the reactor is something like the consumption for half of Munich).

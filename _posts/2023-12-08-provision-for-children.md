Earlier this week we went to Martin’s university together, as I went on a fusion reactor tour. While I was on the tour, Martin looked after Felix - normally it would not be fun for Felix to go to a university building where there is nothing to play. However, in Martin’s faculty building, there is a small room with a sofa, mattress and a few toys for babies and young toddlers to play, so Felix was kept occupied for two hours. It is so good to see such provision for children. (I suppose there are also these mega slides that go from the third floor to the ground floor but one needs to be over 11 years old to use them.)

This week’s high point: we have observed for a while that Felix recognises his dummy and is able to pick it up and put it into his mouth when he wants (sometimes putting it in the wrong way round deliberately so he can chew the hard part). However, we have never seen him doing that in darkness when he wakes up from his sleep, finds his dummy, puts it back into his mouth and falls back to sleep, until last evening. Obviously, he learns that all by himself. Felix is also now crawling more using his knees (rather than sliding on his tummy).

This week’s low point: nothing new to note.

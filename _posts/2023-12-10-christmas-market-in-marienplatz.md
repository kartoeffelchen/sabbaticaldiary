Our friend, Myriam, and her young toddler son came to visit us for a long weekend. We visited the main Christmas market in Marienplatz, the Medieval Christmas market in Wittelsbachplatz and watched the surfers surfing on the Eisbach. It is feeling very festive now - you can see large Christmas trees standing in open squares, the stands in the Christmas markets and the front windows of shops are all full of decorations such as branches from fir trees, baubles, ribbons and fairy lights or candles.

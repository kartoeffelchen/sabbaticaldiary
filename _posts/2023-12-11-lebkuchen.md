Myriam and I baked some Lebkuchen together while our children played with each other today. Baking for Christmas is another activity that we enjoy doing - but if there is no time to bake, one can also buy Lebkuchen and Plätzchen in bakeries or supermarkets. Our favourite local bakery Familienbäckerei Kistenpfennig has the most amazing selection of Lebkuchen - 14 flavours(!) and we have been trying every flavour since November so we had time to sample all of them. And they are very, very good. Lebkuchen (specifically this type, also known as Elisenlebkuchen) is my absolute favourite Christmas treat.

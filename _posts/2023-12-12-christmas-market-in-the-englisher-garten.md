Of all the Christmas markets that I have been to in Munich, the one in the Englisher Garten is my favourite. Why? I like it being small, not too crowded, and there are lots of benches to sit. I also find it pretty to have lots of decorated stalls around the Chinese Tower, and there is a good mixture of stalls selling traditional decorations, food and drinks.

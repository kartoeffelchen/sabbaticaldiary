Felix has regular check-ups done by the paediatrician under the German health system. These so-called U1-U9 and J1 (U stands for Untersuchung, which means examination; J stands for Jugendliche, which means adolescent) take place more frequently between 0-6 months, after that they take place annually up to the age of 5 years old and also at 13-14 years old to check on the general physical and mental development that is appropriate for the age. Earlier the week he had his check (U6) - Felix has reached all the milestones except he does not say words that are doubled up like ‘ba-ba’ or ‘da-da’ but we are told that as he is in a bilingual environment his speech development will be slower. He also received three vaccinations (against 11 diseases) on the same day. As the paediatrician still operates the policy of only one parent is allowed in the practice (legacy of covid), I waited in a cafe nearby and enjoyed a cup of green tea in solitude. 

This week’s high point: I tried for the first time putting food on a fork and letting him grab the fork - and I am amazed he knows how to put the fork into his mouth! 

This week’s low point: nothing to note.

I think in Germany there are more local shops than in England; of course there are chains that you find in all towns and cities, but there are also many local shops. The ones that I love to go in for browsing are homeware shops (I like to look at the huge selection of baking accessories) and stationery shop (I like to look at the greeting cards and pens). I do hope they can compete with chains and online shopping.

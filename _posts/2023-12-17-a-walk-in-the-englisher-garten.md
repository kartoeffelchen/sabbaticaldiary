Martinâ€™s parents came for a day to help us transport any remaining items we had left in our flat, so that on Wednesday when we move out of the flat, we will only take a suitcase, a rucksack and a pram with us on the train to their home for Christmas. We enjoyed a nice Austrian meal together followed by a stroll in the Englisher Garten.

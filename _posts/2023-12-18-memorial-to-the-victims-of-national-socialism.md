One cannot leave Munich without knowing about the role it played during the Third Reich, so today we followed the tour from our guidebook and walked around Odeonplatz and Karolinenplatz, where the headquarter of the Nazi and the Gestapo were located. Not far from Odeonplatz is the eternal light and memorial to the victims of National Socialism, and the National Socialism Documentation Centre (which we went on our first visit to Munich).

Martin’s paternal grandmother (Oma) grew up in a German speaking village not far from Pilsen, Czech Republic and she was expelled from the village where she and her ancestors had lived in for many years. She was one of the many Germans that lived in the area that was known as Sudetenland, so the museum we went to today, Sudetendeutsches Museum, was very educational for us as we learnt the background for the expulsion of Germans from the area at the end of WWII. In the room where it exhibits the belongings as told by those who remembered taking it with them as they left their homeland could I imagine what Martin’s Oma must have felt like when she made the journey to leave her farm and resettled in Germany when she was 22 years old. 

Sadly, history still repeats itself and the role the museum plays to promote peace and understanding (in this case between Germans and Czechs) are still relevant.

It is our last day in Munich - I cannot believe how quickly the last 16 months have gone past. We are incredibly lucky to have this furnished flat that is so close to the Englisher Garten and Philippâ€™s flat so that we can regularly meet up for a walk and dinner; and that it is so close to the metro line which means Martin can get to work easily while I can go to the city centre for my medical appointments and visiting museums. Also, the neighbours in the building (especially the older ones that we meet in the lift) are always very friendly and like talking to Felix. 

One particular thing I shall really miss is our time at Familienzentrum Parkstadt Schwabing. Since November I have been taking Felix there regularly for two to three mornings per week. When I wrote about it last month, I mentioned I did not enjoy talking to other mothers in Open Meet. However, I am getting to know a few people, such as Rebekka and Coretta, who run the place, as well as some of the mothers and their children that regularly go. Everyone is very friendly and helps look after all the children, and the place is clean and well-maintained. This is the reason why I want to take Felix here one more time and to say farewell to Rebekka and the mothers that I know, before we leave Munich today. I really hope I can find a good network in Cambridge when I return. (This photo was taken last week when it was quiet. Normally there are more children when the breakfast is on.)

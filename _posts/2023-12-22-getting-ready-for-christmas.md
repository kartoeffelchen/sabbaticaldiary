We arrived at Martin’s parents’ home two days ago and we had been baking biscuits (Plätzchen) for Christmas. Felix helped emptying items from the basket 😅. 

This week’s high point: Felix’s nap and sleep seems to be better this week, after recovering from his cold, teething pain and the side-effects from his last vaccination. He falls asleep much quicker when it is his nap time (whereas he previously needed lots of holding and singing) and since about three weeks ago, he made the transition of having only two naps a day, each time between 30 minutes to 1 hour long, while he still sleeps for about 11-12 hours at night (and he still wakes up three to four times a night for a feed or to look for his dummy). He has also been eating much better this week (for weeks, he constantly protested and did not want to eat his porridge or purée); he loves the vegetable fritters which I made using <a href=“https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/courgette-fritters-2”>this recipe</a> (omitting the chilli sauce).

This week’s low point: nothing new to report.

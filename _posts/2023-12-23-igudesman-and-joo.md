I absolutely love the comedy sketches by Igudesman and Joo. When I found out they had a show (And now, Rachmaninoff) in Ludwigsburg near Stuttgart before Christmas, I asked for a ticket for the show as an early Christmas present and together with my mother-in-law we went to watch the pair yesterday. It was very funny and witty, especially how they cleverly incorporated fragments of pieces by Rachmaninoff in their own compositions. However, my favourite sketch by them is always ‘<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ifKKlhYF53w">Rachmaninoff had big hands</a>’.

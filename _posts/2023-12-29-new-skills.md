Over the Christmas period we met up with some of Martin’s friends from his school days. One afternoon we went to the new bouldering hall nearby with one of them and his two children. Although Felix was too young to go bouldering, he had fun crawling around on the soft mats. 

This week’s high point: Felix has suddenly picked up lots of new skills since we arrived at his grandparents’ home for Christmas. We think this is due to him having a lot of direct interactions with others and observing what everyone is doing around him. He has started to:
- move his hands like clapping or banging two pieces of toys together; 
- babble more especially with two-syllable sounds (previously he only babbled ‘ah’, now he goes ‘ma-ma’); 
- hold onto a coffee table or sofa with just one hand and walk a few steps or turn around; 
- push himself to stand up by just using one hand (previously he would need to use both hands to pull himself up); 
- imitate our actions such as waving hands.
 
In addition, we have also used the change of scene as an opportunity to reduce his reliance on his dummy, so instead of giving the dummy to him whenever he starts moaning, we only let him have it when changing his nappy or putting him to sleep. This has also helped him to talk more.
 
For me, it is really reassuring to see that he is developing all the skills that he is expected to have acquired for his age. 

This week’s low point: Felix is teething again (this time, the lateral incisors at the top) and he had a few nights when he slept badly, waking up very frequently or refusing to sleep in his own bed.

Felix has gone back to a diet of bread, pasta, fruit and water; he would refuse to be spoon-fed, but at the same time, he did not eat any other finger foods including my vegetable fritters. However, he has finally learnt how to pick up his cup, drink from it and put it down all on his own. Funny enough it was two weeks ago (just before Christmas) when I was really worried that he refused to drink water from his cup even though we had given him the trainer cup at every mealtime since he was around 7 months old. In the last two weeks he became very interested in mugs and he tried to take the mugs from everyone, or he would put his hand in a cup of water and drink with his hand. Suddenly, he learnt to drink from his trainer cup all on his own. 

This week’s high point: Felix could now cruise confidently (i.e. using the sofa or coffee table as support and walking back and forth sideways). 

This week’s low point: there was a nasty stomach bug circulating around the family that several adults and Felix’s cousin got sick last week - it was not nice for those who got ill but luckily we did not catch it.

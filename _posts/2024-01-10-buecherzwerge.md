I took Felix to Bücherzwerge at a local library today. It was very similar to what Felix had already experienced in Munich: the young children and parents or grandparents sat around a semi-circle to sing songs, listen to some stories or watch a puppet theatre for about half an hour. (I think this is similar to Rhyme Time in the Cambridge libraries.) I found it interesting to see that when I read to Felix at home, he gets easily distracted or loses his interest quickly, whereas in the library he pays more attention and he always gets tired and sleeps on the way home.

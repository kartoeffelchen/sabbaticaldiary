Felix will soon be 1 year old. His grandparents treated us a very nice meal to celebrate the occasion. Not only was the food delicious, but the restaurant was very children friendly: they had a very well-equipped toy kitchen for children to play with and excellent nappy changing facilities. 
 
This week’s high point: nothing new to report. 

This week’s low point: Felix hit 12-months sleep regression as he had more night wakings (waking up every two hours) and he refused to sleep in his own bed. It didn’t help that he got a high fever for two days.

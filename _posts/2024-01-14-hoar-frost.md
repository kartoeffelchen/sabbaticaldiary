There was hoar frost today - a phenomenon which I rarely see in Cambridge. Hoar frost is formed when water vapour in air deposited on surfaces (e.g. tree branches) that are below freezing point (the reverse of sublimation). Although it was cold, one could not resist going out for a walk in the sun to enjoy the beautiful hoar frost.

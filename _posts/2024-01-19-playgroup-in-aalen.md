I have been going to a playgroup close to Felix’s grandparents’ home, even though we are only staying here temporarily. Felix benefits from going out for a change of scene as he gets to play with other toys and meet other toddlers. The local association that runs the playgroup also sells second-hand children clothes, and you can even borrow car seats from them for up to four weeks (perfect for those who don't want to take the car seat with them if they have to fly or take a train to get here).

This week’s high point: Felix had been eating a variety of food again. He liked his pizza and cake on his birthday, and he enjoyed eating the same food as what we had for dinner. He had phases - sometimes he only wanted plain pasta and rice, other times he ate everything.

This week’s low point: nothing new to report.

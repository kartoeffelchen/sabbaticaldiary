We were meant to move back to Cambridge after Christmas but Felix’s passport was sent away for a visa application. It was finally returned to us earlier the week, so we could take it to the local town hall for an express passport renewal and get it back after 3 working days! We can finally move back to Cambridge next week.

My time in Essingen has been very good: Granny and I take turn to prepare dinner, and either Opa or I take Felix out on a walk when the weather is nice. I also have my outing to Aalen a few times a week as I either take Felix to the play-group or go swimming. I am also trying to do as much studying as possible while Granny and Opa help me to look after Felix and play with him.

This week’s high point: Felix can now wave good-bye. He has also discovered a lot of things around the house, such as turning a lamp on and off, opening and closing doors, and he knows the floor plan so he can find his way around, such as from the living room through the kitchen to our room. I am particularly impressed by how he knows there are two doors that he can use to go to the kitchen, and if one is shut, he will crawl to get to the other door that is left open to get in. In addition, his sleep seems to be better again (he still wakes up throughout the night but he can sleep for longer stretches of three to four hours, and he can take a morning nap in his bed for a whole hour instead of just 30 minutes).

This week’s low point: nothing to note.

Other things to note: Felix seems to be getting quite attached to me lately - if I want to work, I have to hide from Felix, otherwise even if he is happily playing with his grandparents, if he hears me or notices me walking to the bathroom, he will immediately crawl towards me. I am glad I don’t have to leave him to go to work every morning for now as I can imagine I would have to escape from the house without being seen.

Although I have visited Martin’s home many times, I have never been to the local attraction of the Limes Museum in Aalen!

The ‘Limes’ here refers to the ‘Roman Limes’ which was the border line of the Roman Empire when the territory was at its largest. The well-known Hadrian’s Wall was part of the Roman Limes in the U.K.. And in Aalen there was a cavalry fort that was not far from the Roman Limes and the remains of this fort is also listed in <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430/maps/">UNESCO</a>. The Limes Museum has an excellent exhibition on the items found in the excavations in the fort.

One particular cabinet in the museum showed a large selection of household items that were very well preserved by the owners who had deliberately lowered them into a well when they tried left their house as they were attacked(though they never returned and therefore the items were left in the well).

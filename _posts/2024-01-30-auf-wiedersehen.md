After our 16 months adventure, we are finally leaving Germany today. I have really enjoyed my time in Munich. At times we were frustrated with the admin that we had to do as part of the move (flat hunting, packing and unpacking, sorting out the health insurance and resident permit), however, I also got to experience living in a new place, meeting the locals, experiencing the culture and most importantly, I am now confident in speaking in German, which I was not before. Would I do this again? Yes, definitely. 

As for this diary, I will keep it going, writing at least once a week - though depending on the time I have available I may upload multiple posts at the same time, rather than uploading it once a week.

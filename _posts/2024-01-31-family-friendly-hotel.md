We have not done too much travelling since becoming a family of three, but we have tried a few AirB&B and hotels. While almost all accommodations provide cot beds, this is the first time we stay in a hotel that has a play corner for children - what a fantastic idea! 

And if there are no play corners? Felix will happily play with a TV remote control or the telephone in the room.

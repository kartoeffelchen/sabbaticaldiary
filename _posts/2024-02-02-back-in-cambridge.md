It has been a busy week with all the travelling, including a day trip to London the day after we got back(!) but it is nice to be finally back at home. We will need to do quite bit of unpacking and re-organising because we had to free up the cupboards in the kitchen and the wardrobes in our bedroom for our lodger, and also because we have not done any childproofing so some of our items have to be stored differently. For example, the trolley in the kitchen which we previously used for putting pots and pans has become a shelf for Felix’s toys.

This week’s high point: we went to London yesterday to watch the production of ‘My Neighbour Totoro’ at the Barbican Theatre. They had a relaxed performance which meant children under the age of six were also allowed to go. Felix was very cooperative during the show; he happily cruised along the seats, had a snack and did not cry. We were also impressed by how the RSC adapted an animated movie to a theatre performance with a live band and a singer. It was an excellent production. 

This week’s low point: we did not bring our travel cot back so Felix had to sleep on a mattress on the floor, together with an unfamiliar environment he woke up very easily in the first two nights back at home. In the end, we decided to move him to sleep between us, which is not something I like to do because I know I will have to re-train him to sleep on his own later, but we needed the sleep too.

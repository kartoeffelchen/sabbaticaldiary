We have had a full week back at home and we have been busy with admin and unpacking. Unsurprisingly, Felix is constantly getting in the way, so all the unpacking can only be done in the evenings after he has gone to bed. On a positive note, we have tried the ‘stay and play’ organised by the university’s childcare office in West Cambridge (where the photo is taken) and have taken Felix to a German playgroup in Cambridge, both of these we will be attending regularly during term time. I am sure Felix and I will find a new routine very soon. 

This week’s high point: although Felix has been clapping his hands for a while, he seems to be doing it more regularly, sometimes with no obvious reasons (for example, he woke up in the middle of the night and started clapping his hands). He also is very keen on climbing stairs and has learnt to pull himself up the stool next to the kitchen worktop so he can see better. We all joke that he can climb before even learning to walk.

This week’s low point: nothing to note.

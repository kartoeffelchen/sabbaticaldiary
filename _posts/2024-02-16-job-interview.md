This photo is a snapshot of me preparing for my interview lesson: I did not plan to return to work so quickly but I did not want to miss an exciting job opportunity, so in the last few weeks I submitted a job application. Earlier today I had my interview and got offered the job! It is my dream to teach in a sixth-form school so I hope it will work out with both childcare and part-time teaching and study. 

This week’s high point: Although Felix needs to co-sleep with us he also sleeps longer at night, only waking up once every four hours or so. I think it is better than a few weeks ago when he woke up every two hours. He is also eating a lot of food: we give him three meals a day plus an afternoon snack and he does not need to drink much milk at night. He has also started babbling with different vowels and consonants (like ma-ma, ba-ba, me-me) and is climbing up the stairs confidently. We also think he is growing his pre-molars as he keeps putting his finger into his mouth and scratches his gum. 

This week’s low point: nothing to note.

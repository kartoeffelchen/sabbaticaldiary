March is finally here: the day is getting longer and there are spring blossoms everywhere. 

This week’s high point: Felix has learnt to imitate our actions, for example picking up our hairbrush to brush his hair, picking up the telephone receiver to pretend talking on the phone. 

This week’s low point: Felix has been protesting when we put him in the pram when he is not tired (he associates sitting in the pram with having a nap because we often go out when it is his nap time so he learns to fall asleep in his pram), or he refuses his dummy and screams at a high pitch when he doesn’t want to sleep, even though he is tired. I think on most days in the last week or so we had to fight with him to get him to have a nap or go to bed at night, or get back to sleep at night.

Anne invited us to join Amelia to go to a fun barn where there is an indoor soft play area. It was the first time for Felix - he was initially a bit overwhelmed by the noise and the number of children around him but he seemed to enjoy climbing up the steps to reach the slide. He was completely knackered after spending two hours there. And for the adults we had a nice time catching up.

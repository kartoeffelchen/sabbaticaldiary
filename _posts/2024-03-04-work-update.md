I have almost completed my first module at the Open University. I fell behind slightly for two weeks last month because I was busy with my interview preparation and I got ill. Fortunately, I caught up (after Martin looked after Felix for a few half-days so I could concentrate on my study) and this week I am finishing my assignment. It is now harder to get time to study as Felix sleeps less and is a lot more mobile and active now, so I cannot leave him to play while I look at my book or iPad (I suppose if we have a playpen then he can be left there though I am sure he will learn to protest immediately). Also, since my last work update, I am doing two modules at the same time. Next month I will start a new module which is a continuation of the module I have studied since last October.

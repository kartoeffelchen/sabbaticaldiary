My parents’ favourite activity of the week is to have dim sum lunch on Friday and we sometimes join them after going to the German playgroup. Felix eats very well now and he can eat everything as long as it is not too sweet or salty, which means when we go out to eat we do not need to give him baby food from a jar or packet anymore.

This week’s high point: it has been a good week for Felix’s sleep. We have been slowly re-training him to fall asleep without us holding him and he is slowly getting better at getting his daytime naps even if he is not sleeping in his pram. He is also doing more climbing down the stairs (although more often he seems to slide rather than consciously climbs down). I think there is a certain amount of instincts, as he knows to turn around to face the stairs, stretches his legs out and only moves his body and arms when he knows his feet are touching something hard. It is amusing to watch that he is already climbing before he can walk around freely.

This week’s low point: nothing to note.

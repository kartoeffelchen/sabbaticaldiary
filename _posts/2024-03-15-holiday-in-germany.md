We are going to Germany again to visit Felix’s grandparents and cousin. We are going by trains again; as I have mentioned before, the ICE trains have a family car and this time we managed to get a seat in the small children area, so Felix could play with two boys from another family for part of the journey. 

This week’s high point: I think Felix can say a few words. He said ‘ah ba’ or ‘ba ba’ when he saw Martin after he came back from work; he said ‘ah ma’ or ‘ma ma ma ma’ when he looked for me; he said ‘po po’ when he saw my mother and he went ‘mum mum’ when he saw food on the table. 

This week’s low point: Felix has been using a particular dummy since he was born and it cracked last week when I accidentally drove over it. With the best intention I bought him a new one from the same brand that is a size bigger but he refused to accept it probably because it is harder than the old one (just like wearing a pair of new shoes for the first time). We are not sure what to do: we could use the opportunity to stop him from using his dummy but he has not yet learnt to use a toy for soothing when going to sleep, especially when he wakes up in the middle of the night and wants to be breastfed (which is another thing I need to stop too), so maybe the timing is not great if we decide to get rid of his dummy now.

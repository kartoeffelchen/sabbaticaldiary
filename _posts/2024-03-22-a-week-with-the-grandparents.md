Felix had a whole week playing with his Opa and Granny while we both caught up with some work. He clearly remembered the place and was at ease after we arrived last week. We also went to the playgroup in Aalen twice so he had a change of scene for some of the time. He even featured in the playgroup’s Instagram page which I found quite funny as we only went for a few times in January. 

This week’s high point: Felix has learnt to give or let go of things, for example giving us his toys or giving us his food (even trying to put it into our mouths). I also taught him to drink from a straw by giving him a carton of baby fruit juice. And he can imitate our actions which is always very amusing to watch. 

This week’s low point: there is nothing to note.

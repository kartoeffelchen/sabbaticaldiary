This week’s highpoint is sightseeing in Nürnberg and Berlin: after spending a week at Felix’s Opa and Granny, we had a few days of holiday in Nürnberg and Berlin. The challenge is keeping Felix happy while we go sight-seeing: he now wants to crawl around when he is awake, and if he needs to sit in his pram for a long time, he gets bored. In order to go to the museums, we had to go during his nap time and/or find a quiet corner where he could crawl around on the floor. We also spent more time at the hotel so he could always play for a bit before we went out for a tour or eat at the restaurant. In addition, although Felix eats everything, it is difficult to find suitable food to give him in restaurants (most food is too salty for him but we did give him some potato dumpling, Klöße, which he absolutely loved) - so for this holiday we booked hotel rooms that had kitchenettes so we could cook some simple meals.

In Nürnberg we went to visit <a href="https://museums.nuernberg.de/albrecht-duerer-house/">Dürer’s house</a> (I thought there would be lots of his paintings to see but there are only reproductions - the real ones all in art museums around the world; nevertheless it was interesting to know a little bit about his life through visiting the house).

We went to the <a href="https://museums.nuernberg.de/documentation-center/">Documentation Centre of Nazi Party Rally Grounds</a> and walked around the site, which was a gigantic venue for the rallies that were used as propaganda shows before WWII.

We also went to the Germanisches National Museum and saw the <a href="https://www.gnm.de/your-museum-in-nuremberg/collections/behaim-globe">oldest globe</a> in the world and some doll houses dated back from 17th century.

And we joined a tour of the <a href="https://www.historische-felsengaenge.de/en/experience/historic-rock-cut-cellars">rock-cut cellars</a> to learn about its use in the past.

In Berlin, we went to the <a href="https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/museum">Museum für Naturkunde</a> (natural history museum) where we saw lots of dinosaurs skeletons (some of these were execuvated from Tanzania when it was colonized by Germany, some of these were from Solnhofen including the famous specimen of Archaeopteryx fossil).

Also not far from our hotel is the <a href="https://www.stiftung-berliner-mauer.de/en/berlin-wall-memorial">Berlin Wall Memorial</a> on Bernauerstraße, so we spent some time at the Documentation Centre too.

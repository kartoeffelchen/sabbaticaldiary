We stayed with Felix’s cousin for the last few days and left this morning just before 10 am. Felix clearly remembered his aunt, uncle and cousin, Maxe, and he played happily with all of Maxe’s toys as soon as he arrived. There was also more interactions between the two children (though sometimes Maxe was frustrated when Felix did not understand what he wanted). It will be nice when they can spend time with each other again during the family holiday in September (which sadly, I cannot go). We spent the rest of the day taking trains to Brussels and arrived at our hotel in Brussels just before 6 pm. And surprisingly we did not run into any problems in our entire trip! (German trains are not as punctual and reliable as how they are known outside Germany; the punctuality is comparable to the trains in the U.K., which is not great.)

We returned to Cambridge a few days ago and both Felix and I were suffering from a sore throat / cough / cold. Hence, we did not go out much, though one afternoon we walked to the Orchard Tea Garden in Granchester and we shared a fruit scone.

This week’s high point: Felix can walk - but so far he needs some food as a bait. He would be happy to walk a few steps while holding our hand and focusing on the food he wants to get. However, he is still unwilling to stand up and walk to get from A to B. He will just crawl (which he is very fast and good at it).

This week’s low point: we had a cold for about a week now. I seemed to be feeling worse than Felix but somehow Martin did not seem to catch anything from us.

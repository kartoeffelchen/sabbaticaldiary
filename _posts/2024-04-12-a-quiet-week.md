As my father has been in hospital and playgroups are not running this week (it’s still school holiday), we stayed at home most of the time, occasionally going for a walk or spending an afternoon with my mum. At this time of the year, the meadow outside where my parents live is full of cowslips.

This week’s high point: Felix seems to be sleeping quite well at the moment: he can sometimes have long naps when sleeping on his mattress (which previously he only managed 30 minutes although he can sleep longer in his pram), and he can sometimes sleep through most of the night without needing to be breastfed or sleep with us (his cot bed is still in Germany so we have been co-sleeping with him for a few months now). 

This week's low point: nothing to note.

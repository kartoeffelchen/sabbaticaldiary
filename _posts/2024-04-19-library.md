This week we visited the children’s library near our home for the first time. The library runs rhyme time every Monday morning during term time, but as it coincides with Felix’s first nap, we never go along to it. On the other hand, it was nice to visit one afternoon this week when the library was quiet, so I could do some work while Felix was sleeping in his pram and we spent a short time exploring the children’s corner which was very nice - of course, Felix was more interested in pulling all the books from the bookcase than anything else.

This week’s high point: we have noticed that Felix is getting more interested in listening to us reading him books. We have been reading to him since he was a few months old but it is only until about a few weeks ago that he can finally sit still to listen to us when we read to him. He currently likes the lift-the-flap books the most and he recognises the pictures in the books, for example, in Jill Murphy’s Whatever Next! book about Baby Bear goes to the moon and back, there is a line that said ‘Back down the chimney and on to the living room carpet with a BUMP!’. Whenever I read that, I would tap Felix’s head gently. He now taps his own head when we get to that point in the story, which is very funny.

This week’s low point: nothing to note.

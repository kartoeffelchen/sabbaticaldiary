We are back in our usual routine of going to playgroups (like the one West Cambridge where this photo is taken) and me doing some housework or studying in the evening. We also saw lots of friends in the last two weeks. It was good to catch up with our friends and introduce Felix to them. Felix has done very well that he is not afraid of people he doesn’t know. 

This week's high point: Felix and I had a great outing to Kingston upon Thames - for most of the journey there was step free access and I was grateful for the stranger who took the pram down the stairs for me when there was no lift at the train station. 

This week's low point: Felix woke up from his sleep one evening, opened the door that was left ajar and climbed down the stairs in his sleeping bag as he heard us talking downstairs. We heard a loud bang as he started rolling down the stairs and caught him halfway - fortunately he wasn’t injured in any way but maybe we ought to do some childproofing in the house.

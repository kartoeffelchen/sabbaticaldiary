I always think I should not take Felix into Martinâ€™s office because he would disturb others who are studying or working, so even if we eat in the cafe at the computer lab I feel a bit uneasy. However, Martin thinks it is fine for other staff and students to see a bit of family life even at work and as Felix is well-behaved it is not a problem to take him into the building. 

This week after going to the playgroup in West Cambridge, I took the opportunity to visit Martin's new office. While Felix was there, he inevitably made some baby noises (not screaming or crying but simply saying 'ah-ah') and attracted the attention of some of his colleagues. One of them, Alice, went to her office, found a toy which she had to entertain her children when they visited her office, and lent it to Felix. So it is clear that others also sometimes let their children into their offices. As a whole, the university is very family-friendly, which we value highly.

This week's high point: Felix is learning new things every day but there are two special moments: a few days ago he walked a few steps on his own without holding onto anything for the first time; yesterday at the playgroup he finally understood that in the song 'sleeping bunnies', he had to lie on the carpet in the first part and stand up in the second part - we always sing the song in the playgroup but he only learnt from others through watching their actions today. I almost had a little tear in my eye when I saw that.

This week's low point: nothing to note.

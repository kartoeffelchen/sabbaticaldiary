I have been trying to borrow as many items for Felix as possible so in the last few weekends whenever we visited some friends whose children are older than Felix, we came back in our car with the boot filled with clothes, toys and books for Felix. And if I have to buy him things, I get secondhand if possible. Last week I got Felix a learning tower for Â£0.99 and I was pretty chuffed. I am not into Montessori theory but it will be nice to get Felix involved with cooking when he is older. It is also very useful as a cell to lock him up briefly (for times when I need to quickly run to the bathroom for example).

This week's high point: earlier the week Martin took Felix to the playground when the weather was nice and Martin showed him how to blow the dandelions. Two days later when they revisited the playground, Felix picked up a dandelion and gave it to Martin - he recognised it and remembered it could be blown.

This week's low point: there is nothing new to note.

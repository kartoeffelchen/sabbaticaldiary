Felix turned 16 months old a few days ago. I rarely check his milestones but as his adjusted age (for checking his development) is now 15 months, I did have a look at this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/milestones-15mo.html">website</a> this week.

I had previously worried about Felix’s walking: all the other children in the playgroup that are younger than him by 2-3 months can walk independently, whereas Felix is still crawling. But according to the milestone check, he can take a few steps on his own (just rather reluctantly) so it is fine. Apart from walking, his development in speech is slower than other children but it is to be expected as he is exposed to three languages daily. To quote from a German phrase that is used a lot in Martin’s family: ‘alles im grünen Bereich” (literally: everything is in the green zone - in other words, everything is fine).

Earlier the week we went to Museum of Zoology to meet my former and future colleague (we both changed job to teach in the same school). It's a small museum with plenty of interesting exhibits which I hope Felix will enjoy going there when he is older. 

This week’s high point: Felix has been on his feet walking much more this week! And he is definitely getting more confident each day. One of his pre-molar on the lower right jaw is finally appearing.

This week’s low point: there is nothing new to note.

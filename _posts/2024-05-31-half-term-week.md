It is half-term week so there are no playgroups this week, and as Martin is away for work, it has been much harder to look after Felix (honestly, I am not sure how I will manage without the help from my mother). 

This week’s high point: there is nothing new to note.

This week’s low point: Felix has been taking much longer to fall asleep at night and has also skipped the nap in the afternoon for two times this week - not sure if he is ready to transition from two-naps to one-nap per day - we will see.

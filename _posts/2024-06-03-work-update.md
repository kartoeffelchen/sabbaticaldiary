It is three months since my last work update. I have now done about 50% of the maths module, which I started in February, and introduction to computing and information technology 2 module, which I started in April. On average, I am spending about 12 hours each week to study (the guideline for doing part-time study is around 16-18 hours per week). I manage by doing the work while taking Felix to a playgroup on the bus or while he is sleeping. Most of the time I study at home but sometimes I study in a cafe or somehwere nice like this pond by the Cavendish Laboratory, as long as Felix is asleep in his pram.

We went to Wimpole Hall earlier the week for a little outing. Felix was really interested in watching the farm animals.  

This week’s high point: Felix is now walking more often and steadily. He only crawls now if he thinks he cannot get to where he needs to go quick enough. We have also accepted the offer for a place at the university nursery - it is perfect for us as he will have a place for three full days per week, two of those days coincide with my work (so I have one day remaining for my part-time study) and Martin can still take him to the German-speaking playgroup. 

This week’s low point: there is nothing new to note.

Felix likes his food and can recognise many words, though mostly they are food items (banana, pear, orange, milk, muffin, waffle, bread, yoghurt). He cannot talk apart from saying ‘mama’ and ‘papa’ but earlier the week he signed to tell my mum the mat that he was sitting on was used for changing his nappy. It was the first time he signed after we did the baby sing and sign class in Munich more than half a year ago.

This week’s high point: we took Felix to a swimming lesson for the first time and Felix seemed to really enjoy it. To our surprise, there was no screaming nor crying even when we splashed water at him - he was very chilled. I think the weeks of getting him used to having a shower at home have clearly paid off.

This week’s low point: Felix can get really crossed if he does not get his food (loud screaming) or if he does not like his food (throws it on the floor intentionally) or if he is really, really hungry (crying so much that he does not want to eat the food in front of him).

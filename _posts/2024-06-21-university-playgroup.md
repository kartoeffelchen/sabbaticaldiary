I took a secret shot of the empty playgroup at the university (they have a no mobile phone policy but Felix was the only toddler at the time). It's a shame we will no longer be able to go when Felix starts nursery in September as the nursery days clash with the playgroup days. I like going there, talking to other parents and getting to know the other children. 

This week's high point: Anne and I had a fantastic child-free day-out in London; we ate Japanese food and watched Spirited Away at the London Coliseum (that was my birthday gift from Anne). It was a fantastic production with clever use of props, puppetry and staging and I would love to watch it again. 

We are also trying to train Felix to fall asleep on his mattress on his own. Up till now we always hold him until he falls asleep and we know we could have trained him earlier, but our principle regarding 'sleep-training' is always we only act when we think it's becoming problematic. Right now, we want him to get used to falling asleep on his mattress on his own all the time in preparation for starting nursery. We have been doing this for a week now and Felix is already getting used to it.

This week's low point: Felix is a cheeky boy who likes to push his boundaries and gets easily offended when we say 'no'. Examples of naughty behvouir include: biting us, pulling up my top, throwing food on the floor or spilling water on the table intentionally. He used to climb on his bookcase but since being told 'no' many times he has stopped - we just have to keep nagging him and be consistent.

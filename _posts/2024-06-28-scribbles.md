Felix last transition of three naps to two naps was when he was around 11 months old. He is slowly transitioning from two naps to one nap per day. Ideally, if he does not wake up too early and has a nap at around 11 am till 1 pm, he can stay awake until bedtime which is around 7 to 8 pm. However, as the night is short at this time of the year he tends to wake up too early, sometimes at 5:30 am, so he needs a little nap and it messes up all the naps and bedtime. 

This week’s high point: Felix likes holding a pen and scribbling on a paper.

This week’s low point: nothing to note.

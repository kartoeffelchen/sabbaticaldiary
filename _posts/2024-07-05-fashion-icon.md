Felix recently borrowed Amelia’s old sunglasses. He looks really cool when he wears them though he finds it more fun to keep putting them on and taking them off.

This week’s high point: earlier the week, we did a long day trip to Swindon to visit Yoyo, my friend from Hong Kong (she is currently in Swindon to visit her brother who lives there). Unlike previous train journeys when Felix could only crawl, he could walk up and down the train carriage, wave at everyone on the train, so the journey was easier this time. It also helped that my mum came along so she could help me lift the stroller onto the train or carry my bag. Felix was very well-behaved on the train and a fellow passenger kindly gave him her spare banana. Yoyo and I had a nice afternoon catching up - the last time we saw each other was in 2019, and the children (Yoyo’s brother’s son, Yoyo’s daughter and Felix) who are all about 1 year old apart from each other played together.

This week’s low point: nothing to note.

It is almost Felix’s half-birthday and looking at the milestones by 18 months on this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/milestones-18mo.html">website</a> I realise he has reached all of them (apart from talking) which is reassuring. He likes us reading to him (and is now patient enough to sit through the whole Paddington story, the first one in the series). I am most impressed by how much he understands what we are talking and he knows more words than we think. (According to this <a href="https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/conditions-and-treatments/procedures-and-treatments/speech-and-language-development-12-24-months/">website</a>, a child will have known about 100-200 words by the age of two!) It is delightful to see how happy he looks whenever we talk about food and how he squeaks when we say the word ‘cat’ or when he sees a cat - the squeak is his way of trying to imitate ‘meow’ and he always stops in front of the neighbour’s door when we take him on a walk, hoping that he will catch a glimpse of their cat.

It is also not surprising that he is showing more character, more messing around, more wailing and crying when you say ‘no’, and increasingly, separation anxiety, which he has not displayed previously. He also frequently refuses to lie down to get his nappy changed. But I think there is nothing surprising - he is showing normal development.

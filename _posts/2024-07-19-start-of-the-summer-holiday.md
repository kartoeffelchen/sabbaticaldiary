The week just passed is the last week of swimming classes and playgroups for this school year. We have really enjoyed all these activities that are keeping us busy every morning during the week. I will need to find things for Felix to do to keep him occupied throughout the summer holiday. 

This week’s high point: Opa and Granny have arrived and will stay with us for about 10 days. Felix clearly remembers them and is happy to play with them or go for a walk (as long as I am around).

This week’s low point: Felix needs me to be next to him all the time - this is a new phenomenon that only started a few weeks ago. Previously, he would be fine playing on his own, even if he cannot see me. Lately, he has become very attached to me and as soon as he thinks he is separated from me, he would cry or come to hold onto my legs. It makes it difficult (I can't go to the bathroom when I go to the playgroup or he cannot go for a walk with Opa or Granny without me) and I need to think about how to prepare him for nursery when he starts in September.

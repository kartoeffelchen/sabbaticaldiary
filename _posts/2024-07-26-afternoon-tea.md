It's our wedding anniversary and to celebrate, we had an afternoon tea in a hotel garden that is right next to the River Cam. Felix liked the finger sandwiches and scones and behaved well, so we could properly enjoy the celebration. (Eating out with Felix can be stressful because one of us usually ends up not being able to eat as we have to walk around the restaurant with him.)

This week's high point: apart from the afternoon tea, we also visited the nursery where we met the room leader and key persons. It is reassuring to see Felix happily walking away from us and went straight to the outdoor playing area to play in the mud kitchen while we had a look around - I am confident that he will be fine during the settling sessions in September. 

He has also been sleeping well in the last week - in some nights he could sleep through the night without waking. As a whole he no longer needs to be breastfed at night or in the early hours, so I have now stopped breastfeeding him since last week. It's another milestone for us. Thinking back, breastfeeding was a very special experience but it was hard especially in the first few weeks, and I was lucky to have my midwife who came to visit us in those early weeks and gave me lots of reassurance (she told me that it can take two to three months for the supply of breastmilk to match with the baby's demand - I did have to supplement Felix with formula milk until he was three months old). 

Felix has also worked out how to open the doors - so far we have used doors as 'baby gates' to stop Felix from climbing the stairs or moving from one room to another. 

This week's low point: nothing to note.

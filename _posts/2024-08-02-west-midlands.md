Earlier the week we had a mini-holiday to visit Granny’s corner in England: we saw the place where she grew up, met her friend, Francis, saw the house where her father grew up and visited her father and her paternal grandparents’ grave. It was my first visit to all these places. Felix probably enjoyed playing in the mud kitchen at Moseley Old Hall and petting the sheep and goats at a children’s farm the most.

This week’s high point: Felix can now recognise the names of some animals and he has his own vocabularies for them, which are the sounds which the animals make: 'wau-wau' for a dog, a high-pitched shriek for a cat, voo (his version of ‘moo’) for a cow, 'määh' for a sheep and 'quack' for a duck. 

This week’s low point: nothing to note.

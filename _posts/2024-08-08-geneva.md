We have started our three weeks long holiday in Switzerland. Our first stop is Geneva. We were mostly interested in visiting CERN, which had lots of hands-on exhibits, but what I enjoyed the most were the models of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the detector for the particles, as well as the interviews of the scientists and the engineers whom explained the building and working of the LHC, so even I could not go on a tour, I could still 'see' the inside. To keep Felix entertained we had to take turns to look at the exhibits but fortunately when he was not asleep, he could be easily entertained by automatic doors and pressing buttons in the lifts. 

For the rest of the time we had in Geneva, we walked around the old town, looked at the huge fountain and took a river bus on the lake.

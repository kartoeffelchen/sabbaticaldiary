Before we set off for our holiday, we had a play date at Armin’s, and we invited him to visit us. We knew Armin through the university playgroup. He is about 3 weeks older than Felix and they always enjoy each other’s company in the playgroup, so it is really exciting that Armin will also start in the same nursery as Felix in September and they will still get to see each other twice a week. 

This week’s high point: Felix had his first flight from Heathrow to Geneva. It was not easy to keep him sitting still but he slept through almost the whole flight so it made it much easier for us. 

This week’s low point: nothing to note.

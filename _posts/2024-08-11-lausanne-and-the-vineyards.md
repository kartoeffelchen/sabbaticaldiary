After Geneva, we spent a few nights in Lausanne. The weather in both Geneva and Lausanne has been hot, reaching 30 <sup>o</sup>C every day, so we tried to find activities that we could do in this weather. 

In Lausanne, we walked through a wood to reach an observation deck called Sauvabelin Tower where we had a breath-taking view of the city, Lake Geneva and the mountains. Though I was quite annoyed that we were all bitten by the mosquitoes. We also walked through the old town and walked along the lakeside. 

Just outside Lausanne there are lots of vineyards. One morning we set off fairly early to take a train to Cully and we walked from there, passing the vineyards and the wine-growing villages to reach Grandvaux.

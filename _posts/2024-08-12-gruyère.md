We took the train to Gruyère today. Our first stop was the castle at the top of the old town which was at one point, the home of the Bovy brothers, who hosted an arts colony and had painters decorated the walls of the rooms. We also enjoyed walking the small but beautiful castle garden where we even spotted a swallowtail butterfly!

While we had slices of Gruyère cheese with bread for lunch, most tourists had Fondue or Raclette in the restaurants in the old town. In the afternoon we went to a cheese factory to learn about the process of making Gruyère cheese. Unfortunately, as we were there in the afternoon, the workers had already finished making cheese for the day. I found it astounding that each cattle grazes freely on the hills and eats 100 kg grass every day in order to produce 30 litres of milk, and it takes 400 litres of milk to produce 40 kg of cheese. I also did not know that Gruyère cheese can have different maturity as the ones I buy in the supermarket are 6 months mature and taste milder than the 9 months or 12 months cheese that I tried today.

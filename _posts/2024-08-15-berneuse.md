The Berneuse is the peak directly next to Leysin, where we are staying for a week. We took the cable car from Leysin to Berneuse and from there, we walked to Village d'AÃ¯. This so-called village was the place where the villagers who lived in Leysin stayed in the summer, as they would need to milk their cows which would be spending the summer up in the mountain meadows. The village is now preserved and today, there was a summer festival where members in the local clubs played folk music including the alpine horns and cow bells ringing. It was one of our first proper hike carrying Felix in the carrier and he loved sitting in it.

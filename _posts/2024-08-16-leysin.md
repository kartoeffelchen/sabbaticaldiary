Earlier the week we arrived in Leysin where Martin taught in a summer school for German university students who received scholarships from the German government. During the free time we got, we went hiking in the mountains nearby.

Historically, Leysin was a resort town that was associated with treating tuberculousis in the 19th century. Back then, people thought clean mountain air was needed to treat the disease. There were many hotels and clinics for the patients, and the cog railway was built between Aigle and Leysin to bring the patients up the mountain. However, after the discory of medicine to treat tuberculosis, the demand for these clinics dramatically reduced. Instead, Leysin became a resort for winter sports.    

This week’s high point: Felix has enjoyed socialising with the other children who are also staying here. In fact, it is so nice to see how he can run away from me to play with other children (at this stage it simply means running after another child of similar age) - it’s completely different from a month ago when he had separation anxiety and he would start crying even if I got up to go to the toilet. He is also not scared when lots of strangers say hello to him (even he is ‘shy’ and stands behind my legs when he is actually curious about meeting them), so I think he is definitely ready for going to the nursery in September. 

This week’s low point: nothing to note.

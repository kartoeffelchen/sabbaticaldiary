We are in Zürich, our last stop in the holiday in Switzerland. Martin had to meet some researchers at ETH so we spent a day on our own. I would love to sit in a cafe to drink a hot chocolate but frankly it is too hot for this weather (it is back to 30 <sup>o</sup>C again) and going on a holiday with a 1.5 years old needs some adjustment and basically no itinerary: more chilling time in the hotel, more google searches for the nearest playgrounds and no museum going unless it’s really special and the two of us can go together so that we can take turns to let Felix run and climb around. What did we see in Zürich as a result? We saw a farmer’s market, went into the national bank to exchange an old bank note that was no longer in circulation, walked along the lake and went into the China Garden. While inside the China Garden, we watched a heron catching fish in the pond until it got chased away by the security guard. One evening after meeting up with some friends for a meal, we walked along the river Limmat and saw lots of locals strolling and hanging out with their friends in the bars along the river. We did not do much touristy things in Zürich but it is nice to get a taste of what the locals do.

This week's high point: throughout our travel in the last two weeks both Martin and I had to do some work. When Martin was teaching in a summer school last week, he would be busy in the morning and evening, and sometimes he also had to work in the afternoon to finish editing his book. There were a few days when Felix and I would spend the whole day together but somehow it was less tiring than being at home because I would let Felix run around the dining room and play with the catering staff in the summer school, whom all liked Felix's company.

This week's low point: there is nothing new.

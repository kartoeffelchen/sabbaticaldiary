After Zürich we spent a few days in Essingen and then we travelled to Berlin, where I could get a flight back to England while Martin and Felix continued their journey to Insel Rügen by the Baltic sea for a week of family holiday.

In Berlin we stayed in Moabit because we wanted to stay somewhere close to the main train station - it was only after we walked around here we realised there were lots of playgrounds, all within 10 minutes walk from our hotel. Therefore, we had been taking Felix to different playgrounds while we were in Moabit. One thing I notice is that it seems to be more common in Germany than in England to have sand in the playground, instead of mats under the slides and swings. One evening we also saw a Schuhplatten practice from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAatUU7Rb2U">this group</a> in a room next to the restaurant we ate, which we thought was quite amusing to see!

This week's high point: Felix is doing very well with his sleep - he does not make a fuss that he has been sleeping in different cots or mattresses throughout the holiday and once he is asleep at night, he will only wake up once at around 4 or 5 am and go back to sleep. 

This week's low point: nothing new.

Martin and Felix are on holiday; I cannot join because I have started a new job after two years of sabbatical and maternity leave. Although I am gutted that I have to miss the holiday, it is also nice to have time on my own to prepare for working in a new school. 

This week's high point: Martin dreaded about this part of the holiday because we did not know if Felix would accept he could not see his mother for 10 days - but to our surprise, he got on fine - and was even happy to do things with his grandparents or aunts and uncles so Martin could do some work and get someone to look after Felix for a few hours at a time. Felix also showed a lot more interactions with his cousin (the last time they saw each other in April, Felix was still small and did not have the concept of playing with other children).

This week's low point: I do miss Felix a lot - the house is so quiet and is not the same without Felix's laughter and cries.

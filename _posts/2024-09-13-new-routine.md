Martin and Felix finally returned to Cambridge after their week of family holiday in RÃ¼gen and work in Darmstadt. I took Felix to the playgroup on Thursday but we will have a new routine soon when Felix starts attending the nursery at the end of this month. 

This week's high point: we have debated for a long time when we should get rid of Felix's dummy. He has been using it only for going to sleep or when he is unsettled when travelling, and as he is about to start nursery, we have decided it is time for him to say good-bye to his dummy. We are certain that it will get lost easily in the nursery, and as there is only one dummy he likes - the one he has been using since he was a few weeks old - it's better to tackle sleeping without dummy now then wait till it is lost. The first evening he cried for a good half an hour before he fell asleep without it, but the second evening he cried for only 10 minutes and the third evening, he only protested a bit. The whole process of weaning him off his dummy is easier than I thought.

This week's low point: after Felix spending more than a week with Martin, he is now very attached to him and he needs to follow him to everywhere he goes!

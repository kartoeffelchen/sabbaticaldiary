This week Felix started the settling sessions at his nursery. He had two sessions this week: in the first session, Martin stayed in the room with Felix for an hour; in the second session, Martin took Felix to his room and remained in the nursery (but out of Felix's sight) for an hour. Next week when Felix has his third and fourth sessions, we will only drop him off and leave the site for 1-2 hours, depending on Felix - if he is fine, he can stay for lunch or tea. So far he did well in the settling sessions - he quickly built up his relationship with the key person, Philippa, and in the second session he cried but only for a few minutes. We think he will be fine next week.

This week's high point: Felix signed to my mum to tell her that he wanted to go home, after playing for a while in the playground. Another time, he signed to my mum to tell her that he wanted to go home to have his nappy changed. When they went home, he even pointed to my mum where to get his new nappy and wet wipe. I never thought he had paid attention to all these things!

This week's low point: we are struggling a bit with work-life balance at the moment. Martin always has lots of deadlines to meet and I also need to do a fair bit of lesson planning at the moment because it has been more than 5 years since I last taught Year 13 organic chemistry, as well as some housework (which I am already keeping it to the minimum). As a result, we find ourselves always working late in the evenings and also for several hours in the weekends. Neither of us are happy with this but we can't think of ways to get round it, for example, I could have saved time by cooking simpler meals with ready made pasta sauce and tortellini but at the same time I know this would also make me unhappy as I don't like to eat too much processed food.

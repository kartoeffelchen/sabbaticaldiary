My mother, Felix's Popo, has been helping us by coming to our house to play with Felix for a few afternoons each week, or providing us with lunch or dinner, so we can get some work or housework done. We are incredibly lucky and grateful to have my mother's help. Because Felix sees my parents a lot, he has now built up trust and will be happy to go with Popo to the playground or be left alone with Popo to play in a playgroup or at home.

This week's high point: Felix has had all his settling sessions at the nursery, which seemed to go well - we did not receive any phone calls to say he did not stop crying and Felix could even stay longer to eat his meals at the nursery, which was a success! He is also getting used to putting his helmet on and sitting in the cargo bike for a bike ride.

This week's low point: there is nothing to note.

Since my last work update, I have returned to teaching two days a week and I have also finished two first year modules. I am going to do just one module on algorithm for now because I am not sure how I am managing the balance between teaching, studying and family. Although it is a second year module and several people have commented it is one of the hardest modules in the second year course, I look forward to learning something new. I will try to do most of my study in the evenings and also on Thursdays and Friday mornings when Felix is at nursery or in his German playgroup.

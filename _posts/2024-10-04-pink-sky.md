I do like looking at the pink sky in the morning or in the evening, even if it is ‘red sky in the morning, shepherds warning’. There is something nice about shorter days - you can notice the colour of sunrise and sunset as you have already got up / have not gone to bed yet.

This week’s high point: Felix had his first week at the nursery and only caught a mild cold. NOT BAD.

This week’s low point: He was fine on his first day at the nursery, but for the rest of the week he was grumpy or upset even to go swimming or to the German playgroup. This is when we realise it actually takes a longer time than just four settling sessions for Felix to get used to going to the nursery for a few hours a day, three days a week. However, I do think at the nursery they are doing what they can to calm him down and as they have not even rung us to tell us to pick him up because he was inconsolable, we should consider that he has a good start.

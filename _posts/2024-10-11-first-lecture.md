While I have already had six weeks of school, Martin only started lecturing this week. On Thursday I attended his first lecture to learn a little bit about concurrent and distributed systems.

This week’s high point: Felix is doing a bit better this week at the nursery, and was not too unhappy even Philippa, his key person, was away one day. He eats well in the nursery which is good.

This week’s low point: there is nothing to note.

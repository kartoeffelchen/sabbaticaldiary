October is the start of the cold season and Felix has been having runny nose and coughing since the start of the month. Over the weekend he had a high temperature for two days, but he still had a good appetite, and was fine again by Monday so he could return to the nursery.

This week's high point: despite having a fever, Felix seemed pretty happy after taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen, so we could go to the petting farm in Maidstone with our friend, Myriam, as planned. We had a tractor ride, fed some goats and sheep, though Felix was mostly interested in eating his snacks the whole time!

This week's low point: we still let Felix sleep between us and occasionally he likes to lie across so we end up lying close to the edge of the bed, and this does not lend itself to a good night's sleep. However, I still think it is better than him waking up and crying a few times during the night if he sleeps in his cot. And I get to re-purpose his cot into a ball pit. One day we will train him to sleep on his own bed and in his room - for now, this arrangement works well for us (most of the time).

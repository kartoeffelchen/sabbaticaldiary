I have been experimenting with taking portraits of Felix this week (partly to get some photos for making greeting cards and calendars), which is not always straight forward as Felix is interested in grabbing the camera or is constantly moving around so the photos are blurry. However, I did manage to get a few good ones every now and then.

This week's high point: perhaps since starting nursery (where he needs to be able to communicate to the staff and he has more adults talking to him), we have noticed Felix started to imitate different kinds of sounds more and sometimes, using actual words. Most spectacular was his use of 'Oh Nein' ('oh no' in German) when he dropped something he was holding. He has also started to use 'Nein' (interestingly, never in English) more often than in the past.

We were also told about Felix running to the food trolley as soon as it was brought into the room, and he once went to the room next door to steal the dessert. He definitely likes the food in the nursery.

This week's low point: Felix has been waking up very early, a few times at 5 am or otherwise at 6 am. One morning while I was half-awake and trying to carry him downstairs, I slipped and we both fell - fortunately the turn in the staircase stopped us slipping all the way down to the ground floor and I only had a slight bump on my head and some nasty bruises on my arms and legs.

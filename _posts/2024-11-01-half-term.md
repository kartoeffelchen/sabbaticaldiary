The week just passed was half-term holiday. The start was great: Felix and I met up with some friends and we had a day out in Wimpole Hall Farm (where the photo was taken). The rest was rubbish. Felix had a high temperature in the first weekend and recovered quickly, but we then caught his viral infection a few days later. While Martin only had a high temperature for a day, I had all the symptoms from hand-foot-mouth disease (fever, sore-throat, swollen lymph and a rash). I had hoped to use the week to stay ahead of my study, instead I had to spend most of the week sleeping and I could not eat for a few days. To be fair, I had expected to get ill more frequently either by catching the germs from my students or Felix. Let’s hope we are not in constant cycles of flu and cold in the next few weeks.

This week’s high point: nothing to note - it was a rubbish week.

This week’s low point: in addition to feeling sick, Felix has been waking up at 4:30 am every day! He is still in summer time even though the clock moved back a week ago.

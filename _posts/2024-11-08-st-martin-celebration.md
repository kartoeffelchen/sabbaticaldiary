The German playgroup celebrated St Martin this evening (the actual day is 11th November). The children took the lanterns which they made a few weeks ago for a procession and we sang a few songs about St Martin together. This saint day is not celebrated in England but is widely celebrated in Germany, so it is nice for Felix to experience the celebration in Cambridge too.

This week's high point: 10 days after I started having the symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease I have finally recovered. And I can eat again! (It was not the mouth full of blisters that caused the difficulty in eating, but the swollen lymph that made even drinking water very painful.) And Felix is now getting up between 5:30 and 6 am instead of 4:30 am which is an improvement!

This week's low point: I baked some Weckmann using <a href="https://www.essen-und-trinken.de/rezepte/weckmann-rezept-13397000.html">this recipe</a> for the playgroup to celebrate St Martin but the heating with fan function in my oven suddenly has gone dead. This is rather annoying as I need the oven to make Pl√§tzchen for Christmas.

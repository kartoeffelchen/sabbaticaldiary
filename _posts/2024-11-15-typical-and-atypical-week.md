It has been a bit of a ‘blur’ this week: I am struggling to recall what we have done as it was, on one hand, a typical week with work, nursery, staying at home, and on the other hand, we had a photographer at the swimming class, a friend visiting us, a tour around Magdalene College with my niece and nephew and a meal which I prepared for my mother to celebrate her birthday so plenty of atypical events in the same week.

This weeks’ photo is a collage of photos taken by the nursery.

This week’s high point: Felix is either picking up words or the signs to communicate with others. One of the words is ‘bee’ which I told him from watching a music video and he also learns it in the nursery as there is a bee model in the playground. He is also humming more recognisable tunes, for example, ‘The Wheels on the Bus’, 'Five Little Ducks' and ‘Ich geh mit meiner Laterne’ with the correct rhythm and pitch.

This week’s low point: Apart from getting Felix’s cold (fortunately, just a runny nose and slight sore throat this time), the low point this week is receiving an email from Felix’s nursery saying there is a confirmed case of headlice in his room so we were trying to wash and comb his hair thoroughly to check that he is headline free (which so far he seems to be).

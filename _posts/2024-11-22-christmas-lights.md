It is not even the start of Advent yet but the Christmas lights have already been switched on in Cambridge and of course shops are all advertising for Black Friday or Christmas offers.

This week's high point: Felix has a really good memory of songs and the actions associated with them. I played him something earlier the week that we have not listened to for a few weeks and he remembered all the actions.

This week's low point: going swimming with Felix always requires extra effort anyway and just as I arrived at the carpark before the swimming lesson, an error message in the car popped up to say the car may not restart. After speaking to an agent who told me I could ignore the message and still drive, the swimming lesson was almost over so I had to drive home. And when I got home, the error message disappeared. To make up the swimming lesson at home, I filled up the bath tub at home and we had a bath, which was still fun.

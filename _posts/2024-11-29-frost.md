It has been a chilly week and one morning it was frosty.

This week’s high point: Felix has finally grasped that I am called ‘Mami’ not ‘Mama’. Perhaps ‘Mama’ is easier because it is repeating the same vowel, and most children start saying ‘mama’ and ‘dada’ from 1 year old, whereas ‘Mami’ should be considered the same as other two-syllable words, which on average children only start speaking from around 2 years old. 

This week’s low point: Not a low point as such but a note of Felix’s naughtiness / cheekiness in the house:
After we bought Felix his book case when he was around 14 or 15 months old, he kept trying to climb onto his book case and we have to repeatedly tell him off. He stopped after a month or two. His latest obsession is to sneak up to the plant pot and deliberately with his hand or foot to get the soil onto the floor, even we keep telling him off and smacking his hand. His other obsession is turning the Kugelbahn (marble run) over and standing on it - at least with that I can confiscate it from him, but I cannot do anything about the plant.

To add to the list, there are a few slightly dangerous things which we let him do such as climbing onto the sofa and standing on the sofa, or throwing himself from the sofa across to the armchair (with a few near misses).

And considering that we have no childproofing in the house, such as no locks to lock the kitchen cupboard doors and no stair gates, and that he has not been opening the kitchen cupboard doors to empty out the pots and pans, playing with soil is just annoying for me as I need to clean it up but otherwise it is not dangerous or costly.

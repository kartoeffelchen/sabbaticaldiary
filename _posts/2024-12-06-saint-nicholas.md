Saint Nicholas (Sankt Nikolaus) visited all the children at the German playgroup today and gave each one a bag of gifts containing a mandarin, walnut, biscuits and sweets. The children were all very excited to get the them.

This week’s high point: Felix has been using more words: eyes, eggs, shoe (“doo”), duck, Auto (“auwo”, German for ‘car’), ball and tea. 

This week’s low point: Felix has been ill since Tuesday - it’s not an ordinary cold as he has been coughing really badly, has a high fever for a few days and he has not eaten much. We suspected he got RSV as there were confirmed cases and lots of sick children at the nursery.

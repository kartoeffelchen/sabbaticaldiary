Everything is winding down this week: Felix had his last swimming lesson on Tuesday, I had my last day of work on Wednesday and Felix had his last German playgroup on Friday. On Friday we also went to his nursery for a Christmas market and walked around West Hub where this photo was taken.

This week's high point: I think we all deserve a pat on our shoulders as we have made it to the end of this term. It has been a busy term as we all tried to stay on top of work and study deadlines and it did not help when we got ill.

This week's low point: we are all ill again! After Felix finally recovered from his nasty viral infection he caught a cold again and passed it to us - fortunately it was mild so he only had two days of fever and since then runny nose.

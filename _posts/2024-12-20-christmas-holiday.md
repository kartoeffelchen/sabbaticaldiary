At Felixâ€™s nursery if they have spaces one can attend additional days in lieu of the pre-booked holiday days. As a result we sent Felix to the nursery on Tuesday this week so both Martin and I could get on with some work. Although Felix has no concept of which day of the week it is, he somehow knew it was not the usual routine when he went to the nursery and was moaning more than usual. 

This week's high point: on Thursday after work/nursery we set off to Germany and began our holiday. We took an overnight ferry from Harwich to Hook of Holland and travelled by trains to Germany. Felix coped well with going to bed later than usual and sleeping on a ferry or in a hotel bot.

This week's low point: Felix has been a bit moany at the nursery this week and is protesting more than usual when being dropped off. However, when he is at the nursery he actually sleeps for longer than usual (1.5 - 2 hours) and he happily dances along with the Christmas music. Perhaps it is part of the development to learn to protest and express his opinions as he is growing older.

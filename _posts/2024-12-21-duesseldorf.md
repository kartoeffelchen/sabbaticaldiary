We had a stopover in Düsseldorf for two nights. The main reason was Martin had a ticket for the Igudesman and Joo concert in Düsseldorf as an early Christmas present (sadly it is the final year that the duo are touring so it is the last chance to see them). While in Düsseldorf we only had time to go to the Christmas market and had a nice Japanese meal (which I do recommend - the Japanese food in Düsseldorf is pretty authentic by European standard). However, we also went to the Neanderthal Museum in the Neander Valley that is just outside Düsseldorf - this is the place where in 1856 the remains of a Neanderthal was discovered and provided evidence for the evolution of the human species.

These two photos were taken at the Neanderthal Museum. The top photo showed the exhibits which were models of extinct human species and the bottom photo showed the valley where the remains of a Neanderthal was discovered in a cave (which had since collapsed) while limestone was quarried in the area.

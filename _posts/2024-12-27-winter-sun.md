We had a whole week of cold but dry, sunny weather every day - it is really nice to soak up some winter sun when we go for a walk. 

This week’s high point: Felix’s vocabularies are developing really rapidly, sometimes he masters one new word a day. During this week, he is picking up both English and German words, such as ‘Keks’ (biscuits in German) and 'more'.

This week’s low point: as his cousin was ill with hand-foot-mouth disease, Felix was alone the whole week and towards the end of the week he clearly was getting bored; he was disinterested in the toys or books that we offered him and was getting moany.

Happy New Year! We wish everyone a happy, healthy and prosperous 2025.

The toddlers in the family were given a little fireworks display at the front of the house on New Year's Eve (Silvester). It was Felix's first time to see fireworks and I was surprised that he was not scared by the bright light nor the bangs.

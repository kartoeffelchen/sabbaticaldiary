I have now done about one third of my ‘M269 Algorithms, data structures and computability’ course at the Open University. I enjoy the course but it has been challenging to find the time to do my study because on the days I do not work, I also have to look after Felix and find time to do housework or prepare for the lessons that I need to teach. The two weeks around October / November was especially difficult when I was ill and fell behind my study. I now try to stay ahead of the study schedule so I can have some buffer. I was hoping to start another module in February but as Martin is editing his book at the moment and has a tight deadline to meet in the next few months, I should just stick with doing one module this year.

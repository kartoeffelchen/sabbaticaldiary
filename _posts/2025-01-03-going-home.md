We are returning home today, after spending two weeks at Martin’s parents’ home. It is always precious to spend time with the family and for Felix to see his grandparents, aunt, uncles and cousin. 

This week’s high point: Felix enjoyed going swimming with his cousin - in fact, when he arrived at the swimming pool yesterday, he was so excited and immediately made the swimming sign to me (his sign for swimming involves moving both arms up and down like how one would splash, because this is what he does in his swimming lessons). He also helped baking oat biscuits for the first time. 

This week’s low point: our train from Stuttgart to Paris was cancelled and it costed just as much to rebook the trains and/or book a hotel to stay overnight in Paris so we bought flight tickets immediately - luckily granny and opa could drive us to the airport so we did not have any problem with catching the flight to go home.

We are replacing our gas boiler with an air source heat pump in the middle of a cold spell. Perfect timing isn’t it?! At least the company doing the work has lent us a few electric radiators and we only had no hot water for one day. 

This week’s high point: Felix has a few new words including ‘nice’ and ‘stuck’. The first time I heard saying ‘nice’ when he managed to roll the cars and balls down the ramp in his Kugelbahn (marble run) toy. I am certain he has picked that up in the nursery. 

This week’s low point: Felix has been crying on the way to nursery and at the nursery as he arrives. He was better before the holiday but I reckon he has got used to spending lots of time with us over the holiday and he needs to re-adjust going back to nursery.

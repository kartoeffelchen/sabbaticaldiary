Felix turned two earlier this week. One evening, he was really, really upset: he had eaten a cheese string but was not allowed more. He bursted into lots of tears and cried. We have never seen him so upset before - of course no parents want to see their children get upset or cry but it just shows how Felix has reached the next developmental stage which is wonderful to witness.

Looking at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/milestones-2yr.html">cdc's checklist</a>, apart from the social/emotional milestones which I have not observed too closely, he has met the other milestones (alles in grünen bereich &#128512;)

As for his birthday he has received a few toys and books - this book "Ferdi reist mit seinem Kasperl durch die Münchner Stadt" (Ferdi travels with his Kasperl through Munich) is super special as it reminds me of all the places that I used to go around in Munich during my sabbatical year.

This week’s high point: he is also getting better crying less when he is arrives the nursery and is sleeping better also at the nursery. He has been sleeping an hour in the nursery and he has been going to bed at around 8 pm and getting up at 7 am, waking up only once or twice.

This week’s low point: there is nothing to note.

**March 2021: Martin submitted his grant application**

As Martin would run out of his funding at Cambridge in September 2022, he had to start finding a new research grant. He applied for two grants, one of which was from Volkswagenstiftung (with the condition that he would be working at a university in Germany for 5 years). Initially, he was hesistant as to whether he should apply for the grant from Volkswagenstiftung, because he felt it would be unfair to leave my parents alone in Cambridge. However, taking into account my parents' health, the need for him to have the experience of working in a different university and helping him to climb up his career ladder, the flexibility of remote-working and potentially a chance for me to experience living in Germany - he decided he should give a go. Afterall, it is very competitive to get research grant and there is no guarantee one will be successful even with a strong application.


**April 2022: Decision made!**

Within one week of receiving the email that Martin has been awarded the research grant from Volkswagenstiftung and a position at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), starting from October 2022, we decided to move to Munich for a year!
The main question that I had to address was: what will I do in Munich? There is always the option of getting a job in one of the international schools in Munich, but there is no guarantee there are chemistry or science teaching posts, so I also need some alternatives. Fortunately, around the time when Martin was thinking about applying for this research grant, I also started learning programming by following an online course (at that time I felt a need to have a new intellectual challenge for myself, widen my CV and potentially have this as a back-up if we were to live in Germany). By this point, I felt confident enough that I could keep myself busy by following more online courses and working through my own project while living in Munich, even if I did not take up a teaching post in an international school. The other questions were: what about my current job in Cambridge? What would we do with our house in Cambridge? My parents? etc. We had briefly considered these questions before Martin submitted his application for this grant. 
Nevertheless, we had to make a quick decision on the matter because I only had a few days to give my notice that I would not return to teach in September. Unexpectedly, my school had also been very accommodating and granted me a sabbatical leave, meaning I would still keep my job when I return a year later. 
For Martin's point of view, it would make sense for him to spend the first year at TUM to do some lecturing and supervising students' projects, so he would become familiar with the system in TUM and could hopefully recruit PhD students to work with him, starting from the second year at TUM.


**May 2022: Preparation for the move**

During this month we started researching on the actual logistics of moving to Germany, such as how to apply for my visa and our health insurances, how to take our car with us etc. My other focus was to become more confident when speaking German (even though there are sufficiently high number of English speakers living in Munich), so I have started conversing with Martin in German exclusively and had some conversational practice with a teacher online.


**June 2022: Looking for a flat**

At the start of my May half-term holiday I found out I was pregnant, meaning I would have to give birth in Munich!? This was not something we had expected when we planned to spend a year in Munich.
During half-term we also spent a few days in Munich to get to know the area we wanted to move to, and tried to fit in some flat-viewing but we had no success in securing a place. However, we eventually found one that suited our needs through an online-viewing. We also found a lodger to look after our house in Cambridge for the year and made plans to move to Munich in mid-August. 


**July and August 2022: Packing up for the move**

Because we rented a furnished flat in Munich (which was uncommon in Germany) and we were letting our house out to a lodger, we only needed to empty the drawers and half of the wardrobe in our bedroom and some of the cupboards in the kitchen for the lodger to use. As a result, we did relatively little clearing and packing stuff for storage or taking to Munich. We visited some friends to say a 'temporary farewell' and also made use of the fact that Martin's parents drove over to England for their summer holiday, so we could load up their car, as well as our own car, to take all the things we would need in Munich, without the need of hiring a removal company to transport our items.
We moved to Munich in mid-August and started our exciting journey of living and working in a new city, as well as getting prepared to welcome a new member in our family.
